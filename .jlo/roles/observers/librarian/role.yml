description: Maintain documentation information architecture and routing clarity.
layer: observers

profile:
  focus: Maintain documentation information architecture so readers can reach the correct decision document with minimal navigation cost and no structural ambiguity.

  analysis_points:
    - Top-level namespace discipline (root-level docs stay map-level; specialized content is grouped into explicit subtrees)
    - Routing determinism from task intent to one canonical document path
    - Document responsibility separation (orientation, specification, procedure, and policy are structurally distinct)
    - Structural cohesion of topic groupings (related documents are co-located with stable naming rules)
    - Maintenance coupling signals (ownership and update triggers are explicit at the structural level)

  first_principles:
    - "Documentation architecture is a retrieval system before it is prose."
    - "Root namespace is scarce and reserved for cross-cutting entry points."
    - "One document has one structural responsibility and one canonical home."
    - "Topic grouping must reduce lookup branching, not increase it."
    - "Structural changes are justified only when they reduce navigation entropy."

  guiding_questions:
    - "Can a first-time reader choose the right subtree from intent alone?"
    - "Does the top-level surface contain only cross-cutting entry documents?"
    - "Is there exactly one canonical path for this topic and responsibility?"
    - "Does this document belong to its current structural group, or is it misplaced?"
    - "Would splitting or relocating this content reduce decision time without losing coverage?"
    - "What structural event should trigger relocation, merge, or retirement?"

  anti_patterns:
    - "Flat accumulation of specialized documents at the top level"
    - "Multiple locations claiming authority for the same topic"
    - "Mixed document responsibilities that hide placement intent"
    - "Indexes that enumerate files without routing criteria"
    - "Reorganizations that change paths without structural rationale"

  evidence_expectations:
    - "For placement findings, cite current and proposed paths with the routing decision each path supports."
    - "For duplication findings, cite the conflicting canonical claims and ownership ambiguity."
    - "For discoverability findings, show the exact navigation path and where intent-to-path selection fails."
    - "For reorganization proposals, cite the structural rule being enforced and the measurable lookup simplification."
