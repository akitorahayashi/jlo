# Jules Auto-Merge
#
# Validates Jules PRs with doctor check and enables auto-merge on success.
# Policy gates (branch prefix, .jules/-only scope, draft, duplicates) are
# evaluated by `jlo workflow gh pr enable-automerge`, not inline shell logic.
#
# Flow:
#   1. Jules creates PR → doctor runs
#   2. Doctor fails → Jules detects, fixes, pushes
#   3. Doctor passes → enable-automerge evaluates gates → merges when checks pass
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Repository Settings: Enable "Allow auto-merge"
# - Branch Protection: Require this workflow as status check
