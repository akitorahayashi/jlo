# jlo

CLI tool for deploying `.jules/` workspace scaffolding for scheduled LLM agent execution.

## Architecture

| Component | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------------|
| **jlo** | `.jules/` scaffold installation, versioning, prompt asset management |
| **GitHub Actions** | Orchestration: cron triggers, matrix execution, PR creation, merge control |
| **jules-invoke** | Session creation: prompt delivery, starting_branch specification |
| **Jules (VM)** | Execution: code analysis, artifact generation, branch/PR creation |

## Quick Start

```bash
cargo install --path .
cd your-project
jlo init
```

Then copy `.github/workflows/jules-*.yml` and `.github/actions/read-role-prompt/` from this repository as reference implementations.

## Commands

| Command | Alias | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `jlo init` | `i` | Create `.jules/` workspace with setup directory |
| `jlo template [-l layer] [-n name]` | `tp` | Create new role from template |
| `jlo setup gen [path]` | `s g` | Generate `install.sh` and `env.toml` |
| `jlo setup list` | `s ls` | List available components |

### Examples

```bash
jlo init                                    # Initialize workspace (includes setup)
jlo template -l observers -n security       # Create custom role

# Setup compiler
jlo setup list                              # List available components
jlo setup list --detail just                # Show component details
# Edit .jules/setup/tools.yml to select tools
jlo setup gen                               # Generate install script
.jules/setup/install.sh                     # Run installation
```

## GitHub Actions Workflows

This repository includes reference workflow implementations in `.github/`:

| File | Type | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `workflows/jules-workflows.yml` | Orchestrator | Coordinates all agent execution |
| `workflows/jules-automerge.yml` | Automation | Auto-merge jules/* branches |
| `workflows/run-observer.yml` | Reusable | Execute single observer |
| `workflows/run-decider.yml` | Reusable | Execute decider |
| `workflows/run-planner.yml` | Reusable | Execute single planner |
| `workflows/run-implementer.yml` | Reusable | Execute single implementer |
| `actions/read-role-prompt/` | Action | Read prompt.yml from role |

**Branch Strategy**:

The branch strategy isolates agent operations from the main development line until changes are reviewed or verified.

| Branch Pattern | Agent Type | Base Branch | Description | Merge Strategy |
|----------------|------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| `jules` | N/A | `main` | Dedicated integration branch for agent coordination. Acts as the stable base for all operational agents (observers, deciders, planners). | Synced daily from `main` |
| `jules/obs/*` | Observers | `jules` | Generated by observers. Contains analysis reports and state updates in `.jules/`. | Auto-merged to `jules` |
| `jules/decider/*` | Deciders | `jules` | Generated by deciders. Contains event analysis and planning triggers. | Auto-merged to `jules` |
| `jules/planner/*` | Planners | `jules` | Generated by planners. Contains task breakdown files. | Auto-merged to `jules` |
| `jules/impl/*` | Implementers | `main` | Generated by implementers. Contains actual application code changes. | **Human Review Required** (PR to `main`) |

**Flow**:
1. **Sync**: `jules` branch is synced from `main` daily at 00:00 UTC.
2. **Analysis**: Observers run on `jules`, committing reports back to `jules`.
3. **Planning**: Deciders and Planners work on `jules` to generate tasks.
4. **Implementation**: Implementers pick up tasks from `jules` but branch off `main` to create `jules/impl/*` PRs.

## Development

```bash
cargo build                                                    # Build
cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy -- -D warnings               # Lint
cargo test --all-targets --all-features                        # Test
```
