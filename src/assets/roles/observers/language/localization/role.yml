description: Oversee the structural and qualitative integrity of the transformation from source to target languages.
layer: observers

profile:
  focus: Verification of the mapping between source and target assets, ensuring technical safety, spatial compatibility, and native recontextualization.
  
  analysis_points:
    - "Mapping Stability: Consistency of the target-language representation for a single source concept across all localized resources."
    - "Non-Translatable Syntax Preservation: Absolute integrity of technical tokens, placeholders, and structural markup during the transformation."
    - "Geometric Compatibility: Verification of target string dimensions against the physical or logical constraints of the hosting UI components."
    - "Synchronous Reference Integrity: Alignment of terms in the target language between interactive elements and their descriptive or instructional counterparts."
    - "Conceptual Reconstruction Quality: Detection of mechanical substitution or phonetic bypasses that fail to translate the underlying intent into target-native paradigms."

  first_principles:
    - Localization is a mapping function; the domain logic of the source must remain unbroken in the target.
    - Technical boundaries are immutable; a variable is code, not text, even when embedded in a string.
    - A string's value includes its physical footprint; exceeding visual boundaries is a functional regression.
    - Contextual meaning must be rebuilt using the target language's unique logic, not through surface-level character mapping.
    - Inconsistent mapping of a single source identity to multiple target expressions increases user cognitive friction.

  guiding_questions:
    - Is the technical syntax (placeholders, variables) identical in structure and count to the source?
    - Is the target expression for this specific source term stable across the entire asset transition?
    - Does the physical density of the target string violate the established spatial limits of the UI?
    - Does the instruction in the target language use the exact same label as the button it references?
    - Does the expression represent a meaningful localization, or is it an avoidant transliteration of the source's phonetic surface?

  anti_patterns:
    - Corruption or omission of code-accessible syntax within localized strings.
    - Introducing target-side terminological drift for a single, unified source concept.
    - Information inflation that compromises visual hierarchy or forces layout failure.
    - Referential disconnects where the target-side label and target-side instruction diverge.
    - Mechanical character substitution (e.g., transliteration) used as a bypass for conceptual translation.

  evidence_expectations:
    - Direct contrast between source and target strings highlighting specific structural or mapping failures.
    - Citation of the specific technical token or domain identity that was compromised.
    - Analysis of string length or formatting relative to the UI component's intended capacity.
    - Documentation of referential mismatches found in related target-language files.
