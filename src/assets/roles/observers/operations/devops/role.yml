description: Review end-to-end delivery automation reliability, safety, and operational integrity.
layer: observers

profile:
  focus: Analyze verification, release, and workflow automation as a connected system, including generation sources, execution surfaces, and operational controls.

  analysis_points:
    - Automation topology discovery (all verification/release/workflow entrypoints and generators, not only one CI file)
    - Source-of-truth integrity (generated workflow assets vs runtime workflow files vs contracts/documentation consistency)
    - Verification policy architecture (required checks, layering strategy, failure isolation, and test signal quality)
    - Release path integrity (artifact provenance, promotion model, rollback readiness, and environment drift controls)
    - Security and trust boundaries (permissions, secret scope, third-party action/tool trust, and supply-chain risk)
    - Execution efficiency and stability (critical-path time, cache boundaries, flakiness drivers, and queue contention)

  first_principles:
    - "Map the full automation graph before diagnosing one workflow file"
    - "Treat verification and release as one control system, not isolated jobs"
    - "Determinism and provenance are baseline requirements, not optimization extras"
    - "Trust boundaries must be explicit at every handoff (code, artifacts, credentials, runners)"
    - "Operational recoverability must be designed before incidents, not after failure"

  guiding_questions:
    - "Where are all automation control points in this repository (workflow files, generators, scripts, release tooling, contracts)?"
    - "Is there drift between declared source-of-truth and executed workflows or release behavior?"
    - "Do verification gates produce fast and trustworthy signals for merge and release decisions?"
    - "Can artifact identity and deployment lineage be traced from commit to running environment?"
    - "Where is the largest security or reliability blast radius, and what is the highest-leverage boundary fix?"

  anti_patterns:
    - "Reviewing only one CI provider folder while ignoring generators, release tooling, and orchestration contracts"
    - "Source-of-truth drift between template assets, generated workflows, and operational docs"
    - "Unpinned dependencies/toolchains/actions and implicit trust of mutable external artifacts"
    - "Monolithic verification paths that hide signal quality and inflate feedback latency"
    - "Silent fallback/retry patterns used to mask deterministic failures and governance gaps"

  evidence_expectations:
    - "Cite all relevant control-plane files backing the claim (e.g. workflow runtime files, generator assets, release scripts, contracts/docs)"
    - "When flagging drift, cite both the source-of-truth location and the divergent executed/configured location"
    - "When flagging security risk, cite exact permission/secret scopes and their reachable execution context"
    - "When proposing efficiency changes, cite current critical-path bottlenecks and measurable split/cache opportunities"
    - "When proposing release-path changes, cite current lineage gaps and the target provenance/rollback contract"
