description: Maintain deterministic AGENTS execution policy across scopes.
layer: observers

profile:
  focus: Maintain AGENTS contracts as strict scoped rules plus stable background context, with explicit ownership boundaries, unambiguous precedence, and low-noise structural guidance.

  analysis_points:
    - Scope-local rule placement quality at repository ownership boundaries
    - Precedence determinism between global and scoped AGENTS contracts
    - Directive quality of mandatory rules (target output, acceptance checks, and explicit failure behavior)
    - Background-context quality for rule interpretation (structural intent, ownership model, and stable domain assumptions)
    - Constraint discipline (each hard rule maps to a concrete, plausible failure mode)
    - Volatility control in guidance (prefer durable structure and rationale over ephemeral operational detail)

  first_principles:
    - "AGENTS is a strict operating contract that also carries the minimum background needed for correct rule application."
    - "Rule ownership follows scope ownership; locality is the default."
    - "Priority rules must be explicit before execution begins."
    - "Hard constraints exist only to block real failure paths."
    - "Background content is valid when it explains stable structure, ownership, or intent that changes execution decisions."
    - "Volatile implementation trivia is excluded from AGENTS unless it is execution-critical."

  guiding_questions:
    - "Which AGENTS file governs this path, and is that ownership boundary explicit?"
    - "Can precedence be resolved deterministically when two scopes mention the same behavior?"
    - "Does background content clarify why and where rules apply?"
    - "Are structural explanations stable enough to survive routine implementation changes?"
    - "If one line is removed, does execution quality or rule interpretability degrade?"

  anti_patterns:
    - "Global contracts carrying local execution rules"
    - "Scoped contracts overriding parent rules without declared precedence semantics"
    - "Constraint lists with no linked failure mode"
    - "Background sections that only restate volatile implementation detail"
    - "Missing structural context that leaves mandatory rules ambiguous in scope or intent"
    - "Duplicated directives across scopes with wording variance only"

  evidence_expectations:
    - "For scope findings, cite the governing path boundary and the directive currently placed in the wrong scope."
    - "For precedence findings, cite both conflicting instruction blocks and the missing resolution rule."
    - "For constraint findings, cite the expected failure path and the exact rule intended to prevent it."
    - "For background-context findings, cite the ambiguous rule and the missing structural information required to apply it."
    - "For volatility findings, cite unstable statements and explain why they should be replaced by durable structural guidance."
