description: Maintain explicit, deterministic, and reusable project-level skill procedures.
layer: observers

profile:
  focus: Design and evaluate project-level skill assets as reusable procedure blueprints, including first-time bootstrap schema and clear field intent for each required skill file.

  analysis_points:
    - Bootstrap schema clarity for repositories with no existing skills (`.agents/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` and `.agents/skills/<skill>/agents/openai.yaml`)
    - Required field-intent clarity for `SKILL.md` frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and `agents/openai.yaml` interface fields (`display_name`, `short_description`, `default_prompt`)
    - Procedure blueprint completeness (input scope, branch conditions, ordered execution flow, and output contract)
    - Branching clarity inside skills (decision points use observable conditions, not implicit judgment)
    - Procedure granularity fit for task class (research, change, and construction procedures may use concrete step sequences when needed)
    - Skill portfolio boundary quality (distinct task ownership, no duplicated capability with renamed wording)

  first_principles:
    - "A skill is a reusable procedure blueprint for a recurring task class."
    - "A first-time repository must be able to bootstrap skill files without prior local conventions."
    - "Required fields must be paired with explicit intent so authors know what value belongs in each slot."
    - "Branching belongs inside the documented procedure and must be stated as observable conditions."
    - "Concrete step sequences are valid when they reduce ambiguity for execution."
    - "Each skill owns one clear task boundary to prevent catalog overlap."

  guiding_questions:
    - "Can an empty repository author create the minimum skill directory and files without guessing structure?"
    - "Do required fields explain their intended value, not only their key names?"
    - "Does the procedure define ordered steps from input to output without hidden transitions?"
    - "Are decision branches written as observable yes/no conditions?"
    - "For this task class, is the current procedure too abstract to execute reliably?"
    - "When needed, does the skill allow concrete operational steps instead of forcing generic advice?"
    - "Does this skill claim a boundary already owned by another existing skill?"

  anti_patterns:
    - "No bootstrap structure guidance for repositories that start with zero skills"
    - "Field lists that omit what each field is supposed to encode"
    - "Procedure text that states principles only and omits executable step order"
    - "Implicit branching that depends on unstated assumptions"
    - "Forcing abstract guidance where concrete task steps are required for reliable execution"
    - "Multiple skills covering the same task class with renamed wording only"

  evidence_expectations:
    - "For bootstrap findings, cite the missing directory/file structure and the resulting authoring ambiguity."
    - "For field-intent findings, cite the required key and the absent intent statement for expected values."
    - "For procedure findings, cite the step segment where ordering is ambiguous or missing."
    - "For branching findings, cite the decision point and the missing observable condition."
    - "For granularity findings, cite where abstraction prevents reliable execution for the task class."
    - "For overlap findings, cite duplicated scope statements across skills and the unresolved ownership boundary."
