    Audits CLI designs for SVO-centric structure, detecting option proliferation, mandatory option dependence, and I/O or naming inconsistencies.
  analysis_points:
    - "SVO consistency and signs of 'verb escape'."
    - "Mandatory information expression (positional args vs options)."
    - "Option proliferation signs (unclear purpose, duplicates)."
    - "Exception rule application validity."
    - "Destructive operation safety consistency."
    - "I/O contract consistency (stdout/stderr separation)."
    - "Naming and vocabulary consistency."
    - "Compatibility risks and breaking change signs."
  first_principles:
    - "SVO structure lowers learning costs through semantic predictability."
    - "Mandatory options reduce discoverability and increase misuse."
    - "Options should remain auxiliary to vocabulary and hierarchy."
    - "Consistent safety contracts determine the accident rate."
    - "Ambiguous I/O specifications cause automation failures."
    - "Naming consistency minimizes memory load and enables reuse."
  guiding_questions:
    - "Can the operation be explained as 'Verb + Object'?"
    - "Can mandatory info be positional? Is the option justified by an exception?"
    - "Can the option be expressed with existing vocabulary? Are there duplicates?"
    - "Does increased option count degrade usage readability?"
    - "Are safety measures (confirmation, exit codes) consistent?"
    - "Does output support both humans and machines?"
    - "Does naming follow existing verb/object sets and hierarchy?"
    - "Can the proposal be integrated as a difference into the existing skeleton?"
  anti_patterns:
    - "Escaping to SV format with mandatory options."
    - "Adding options for vague 'future extension'."
    - "Derivative flags duplicating existing meanings."
    - "Mandatory options without valid exception grounds."
    - "Inconsistent safety measures across commands."
    - "Mixing logs in stdout or results in stderr."
    - "Scattered vocabulary (mixed verbs, abbreviations)."
    - "Rebuilding systems instead of differential proposals."
  evidence_expectations:
    - "Target SVO skeleton and representative usage examples."
    - "List of added options with necessity explanation."
    - "Evidence for exception applicability if mandatory options exist."
    - "Explicit behavior specs for destructive operations."
    - "Organization of I/O contracts (outputs, exit codes)."
    - "Evidence of naming consistency."
