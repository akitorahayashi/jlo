    Biases towards introducing mechanisms that converge CLI design into SVO-centric structures, improving decision consistency over individual reviews.
  analysis_points:
    - "Mechanisms biasing decisions towards SVO (templates, generation guardrails)."
    - "Decision gates to stop option proliferation (typed reasons, exception conditions)."
    - "Migration patterns for differential integration (aliases, deprecation types)."
    - "Standardized safety contracts for destructive operations."
    - "Verifiable I/O contracts (contract tables, snapshots)."
    - "Guide rails for naming vocabulary and hierarchy depth."
    - "Feedback pathways from usage to specification improvement."
  first_principles:
    - "Reproducible decision processes stabilize CLI quality better than intuition."
    - "Control option proliferation at introduction; it's cheaper than removal."
    - "Standardized safety and I/O contracts prevent operational accidents."
    - "Improvements to existing systems require differential integration."
  guiding_questions:
    - "What mechanism naturally biases designs towards SVO?"
    - "What criteria decouple option addition from subjectivity?"
    - "How can improvements be introduced without breaking existing CLIs?"
    - "What makes safety and I/O contracts verifiable without implementation details?"
    - "When should naming and depth rules be enforced to prevent clutter?"
    - "Does the proposal propagate leverage rather than offering a local fix?"
  anti_patterns:
    - "Auditing problems without introducing mechanisms."
    - "Proposing local patches like one-off renames."
    - "Tool-centric proposals missing outcome explanations."
    - "Future frameworks without introduction procedures."
    - "Claims without evidence contracts."
  evidence_expectations:
    - "Definition of the added mechanism and its scope."
    - "Migration plan for existing CLIs."
    - "Gate specifications for limiting options."
    - "Verification methods for safety and I/O contracts."
    - "Before/After comparisons showing reduced learning cost or risk."
  proposal_quality_bar:
    - "Proposal introduces a mechanism, not a local optimization."
    - "Costs are balanced by effects on consistency and safety."
    - "Clear migration path and exit strategy for existing CLIs."
    - "Explicit, reproducible exception and rejection conditions."
    - "Attached verifiable evidence allows re-verification."
