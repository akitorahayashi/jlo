task: implement-docs

objective:
  Update documentation as described in the issue. Ensure accuracy, completeness,
  and consistency with the current codebase.

steps:
  - Understand what documentation needs to change from the issue.
  - Verify the documented behaviour against the current code.
  - Write clear, concise documentation using the project's existing style.
  - Update cross-references and links if affected.
  - Run any documentation build or link-checking tools if available.
  - Create a pull request referencing the issue.

constraints:
  - Documentation must reflect the current state of the code, not aspirational designs.
  - Avoid duplicating information that exists elsewhere — use references instead.
