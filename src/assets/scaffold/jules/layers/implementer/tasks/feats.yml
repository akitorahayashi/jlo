task: implement-feat

objective:
  Implement the new feature described in the requirement. Deliver working, tested code
  that integrates cleanly with the existing codebase.

steps:
  - Understand the feature specification and acceptance criteria in the requirement.
  - Design the implementation approach before writing code.
  - Implement the feature with appropriate abstractions.
  - Add comprehensive tests covering the new behaviour.
  - Update documentation if the feature changes public APIs or user-facing behaviour.
  - Run the project's verification suite (tests, linting, type checks).
  - Create a pull request referencing the requirement.

constraints:
  - "Remove obsolete and deprecated code during feature work."
  - "Use names that express a single, unambiguous responsibility."
  - "Enforce single ownership for each concern."
  - "Keep layer responsibilities explicit and non-overlapping."
  - "Preserve one-way dependency direction and block boundary violations."
  - "Prevent semantic overlap in module vocabulary."
  - "All development-related documentation must be written in English."
  - "Use declarative documentation that describes current state."
  - "Preserve correct existing content while integrating updates without duplication."
