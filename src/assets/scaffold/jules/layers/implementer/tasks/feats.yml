task: implement-feat

objective:
  Implement the new feature described in the issue. Deliver working, tested code
  that integrates cleanly with the existing codebase.

steps:
  - Understand the feature specification and acceptance criteria in the issue.
  - Design the implementation approach before writing code.
  - Implement the feature with appropriate abstractions.
  - Add comprehensive tests covering the new behaviour.
  - Update documentation if the feature changes public APIs or user-facing behaviour.
  - Run the project's verification suite (tests, linting, type checks).
  - Create a pull request referencing the issue.

constraints:
  - New public interfaces must have documentation.
  - Feature flags or configuration should be used when the feature is non-trivial and incremental delivery is preferable.
