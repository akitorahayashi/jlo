task: create_idea
phase: creation

objective:
  Draft one new idea (idea.yml) informed by codebase inspection and persona identity.
  The idea is a hypothesis — refinement and feedback happen in the refinement phase.

steps:
  - Inspect the codebase and recent changes; check recent_proposals in perspective.yml to avoid duplicates.
  - Create idea.yml conforming to schemas/idea.yml.

output:
  - .jules/exchange/innovators/<persona>/idea.yml

constraints:
  - "Do not create proposal.yml or modify perspective.yml during this phase"
