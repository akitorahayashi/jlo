task: create_proposal
mode: direct

objective:
  Create proposal.yml from repository context and persona perspective.

steps:
  - Inspect repository behavior, boundaries, and runtime assumptions before drafting conclusions.
  - Check perspective.yml recent_proposals and reject equivalent proposal directions.
  - Update perspective.yml repository_observations and thinking_notes with concise evidence and rationale.
  - Update perspective.yml feedback_assimilation.next_focus with follow-up validation tasks.
  - Create proposal.yml with importance, impact_surface, implementation_cost, consistency_risks, and verification_signals.
  - Update perspective.yml recent_proposals (FIFO, max 5, newest first) with the proposal title.

output:
  - .jules/exchange/innovators/<persona>/proposal.yml
  - .jules/exchange/innovators/<persona>/perspective.yml (updated)

constraints:
  - "proposal.yml must be justified by repository evidence gathered in this run"
  - "recent_proposals must include the current proposal title and keep FIFO max 5"
  - "If the direction is equivalent to recent_proposals, fail explicitly instead of emitting proposal.yml"
