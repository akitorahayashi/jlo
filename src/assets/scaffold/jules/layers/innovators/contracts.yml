layer: innovators
branch_prefix: jules-innovator-

purpose:
  Generate improvement proposals through persona-driven ideation and refinement.
  Each persona inspects the codebase through its own lens, produces ideas, receives
  observer feedback, and refines ideas into structured proposals.

constraints:
  - "Do not duplicate items already listed in perspective.yml recent_proposals"
  - "Do not create proposal.yml for any direction that is equivalent to entries in perspective.yml recent_proposals, even when not yet adopted"
  - "Repository investigation is mandatory in both phases: codebase behavior, runtime assumptions, and open requirement context"
  - "All outputs must conform to the corresponding schema in .jules/layers/innovators/schemas/"
  - "Proposals must introduce boundary, behavior, or decision-quality changes — not local refactoring findings"
  - "Self-check against role.yml proposal_quality_bar and evidence_expectations"
  - "Branch names must start with the prefix jules-innovator-"
  - "Do not modify files outside of the .jules/ directory."
