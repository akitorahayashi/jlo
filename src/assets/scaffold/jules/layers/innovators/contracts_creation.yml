layer: innovators
branch_prefix: jules-innovator-
phase: creation

purpose:
  Draft one new idea (idea.yml) informed by codebase inspection and persona
  identity. The idea is a hypothesis, not a finished proposal — refinement
  and feedback happen in a later phase.

inputs:
  - Source code and repository files
  - .jlo/roles/innovators/<role>/role.yml (persona definition)
  - .jules/exchange/innovators/<persona>/perspective.yml (persona memory)
  - .jules/exchange/changes.yml (recent changes, if present)
  - .jules/roles/innovators/schemas/idea.yml (idea schema)

outputs:
  - .jules/exchange/innovators/<persona>/idea.yml

workflow:
  - "1. Read role.yml and perspective.yml to establish identity and context"
  - "2. Inspect the codebase and recent changes; check recent_proposals in perspective.yml to avoid duplicates"
  - "3. Create idea.yml conforming to schemas/idea.yml"
  - "4. Self-check against role.yml proposal_quality_bar and evidence_expectations"

constraints:
  - "Do not duplicate ideas already listed in perspective.yml recent_proposals"
  - "Do not create proposal.yml or modify perspective.yml during this phase"
