layer: observers
branch_prefix: jules-observer-

purpose:
  Inspect the codebase through the lens of your specialized role (role.yml) and
  emit 0-3 high-signal, evidence-backed findings as events. Maintain continuity
  across runs via workstation memory (perspective.yml).

inputs:
  - Source code and repository files
  - .jlo/roles/observers/<role>/role.yml (role definition)
  - .jules/workstations/<role>/perspective.yml (workstation memory)
  - .jules/exchange/changes.yml (recent changes, if present — advisory, does not restrict scope)
  - .jules/exchange/issues/**/*.yml (open issues, for deduplication)
  - .jules/exchange/events/<state>/*.yml (recent events, for deduplication)
  - .jules/roles/observers/schemas/event.yml (event schema)
  - .jules/roles/innovators/schemas/comment.yml (observer-to-innovator feedback schema)

outputs:
  - .jules/exchange/events/pending/*.yml
  - .jules/workstations/<role>/perspective.yml
  - .jules/exchange/innovators/<persona>/comments/*.yml (if innovators scheduled and idea.yml exists)

constraints:
  - Do not duplicate findings already covered by open issues or recent events
  - Workstation memory is perspective.yml only; do not create per-run history files
  - "changes.yml is advisory context — it does not restrict inspection scope"
  - "Goals must be validated every run; replace stale or completed goals"
