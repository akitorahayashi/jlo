purpose:
  Triage observer events into actionable issues. Verify each event against the
  current codebase, discard stale observations, rationalize conflicts, and
  aggregate valid events into issues for downstream processing.

constraints:
  - Issue filenames use kebab-case title; IDs are 6-char random lowercase alphanumeric
  - When requires_deep_analysis is true, deep_analysis_reason must be non-empty
  - verification_criteria must be clear and actionable; do not specify executable commands
