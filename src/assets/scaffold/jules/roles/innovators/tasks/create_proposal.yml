task: create_proposal
mode: direct

objective:
  Produce proposal.yml in a single pass without observer feedback.
  This path is intended for direct layer invocation where proposal publication speed
  is prioritized over the standard feedback loop.

steps:
  - Inspect repository behavior and constraints directly before drafting conclusions.
  - Update perspective.yml repository_observations and thinking_notes with the rationale used for direct publication.
  - Update perspective.yml feedback_assimilation.next_focus with follow-up validation tasks.
  - Create proposal.yml with importance, impact_surface, implementation_cost, consistency_risks, and verification_signals.
  - Update perspective.yml recent_proposals (FIFO, max 5, newest first) with the proposal title.
  - Delete idea.yml if it exists.
  - Delete comments/*.yml if any are present.

output:
  - .jules/exchange/innovators/<persona>/proposal.yml
  - .jules/exchange/innovators/<persona>/perspective.yml (updated)

constraints:
  - "Do not wait for observer feedback in this direct mode task"
  - "recent_proposals must include the current proposal title and keep FIFO max 5"
