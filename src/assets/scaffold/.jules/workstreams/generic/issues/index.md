# Issues Index

This registry tracks active issues in this workstream.
It serves as the central source of truth for the **Decider** to deduplicate observations.

## Directory Structure

Issues are stored as YAML files in priority-based directories:

- [`high/`](./high/) – Critical blockers and major defects
- [`medium/`](./medium/) – Standard bugs and improvements
- [`low/`](./low/) – Minor tweaks and housekeeping

## Active Issues

| Priority | ID | Title |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| - | - | _No open issues_ |

<!--
Instructions for Decider:
1. This table must reflect all .yml files in high/medium/low.
2. Sort by Priority (High > Medium > Low).
3. Use this index to check if an incoming observation is already covered.
