layer: narrator
branch_prefix: jules-narrator-

purpose:
  Produce the first-ever change summary (.jules/changes/latest.yml) by
  inspecting recent commit history. No prior summary exists.

inputs:
  - .jules/roles/narrator/schemas/change.yml (authoritative output schema)
  - Git history within the commit range described in Run Context

output:
  - .jules/changes/latest.yml (created new)

workflow:
  - 1. Read schemas/change.yml to understand the output structure
  - 2. Inspect the commit range from Run Context using git (log, diff --stat, show --stat) to gather stats and understand change scope
  - 3. Synthesize a high-level English summary organized by change themes (not per-commit)
  - 4. Set selection_mode to "bootstrap" in the output
  - 5. Fill every field in schemas/change.yml and write .jules/changes/latest.yml

constraints:
  - Output must match schemas/change.yml exactly
  - Exclude .jules/ and .jlo/ from all diffs and path lists
  - summary.notable_changes: at most 5 theme-level bullets
  - summary.truncation_note: non-empty when commits_total > commits_included
