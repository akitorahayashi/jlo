# Merger Layer Contract

## Purpose
Consolidate parallel observer branches into a single consistency branch.

## Branch Naming Convention
All agents must use the following branch naming format:
```
jules/<role>-<YYYYMMDD>-<HHMM>-<short_id>
```

Examples:
- jules/observer-taxonomy-20260128-1345-a1b2
- jules/merger-consolidator-20260128-1415-e5f6

## Workflow

1. **List Branches**: Identify all branches matching `jules/observer-*`
2. **Filter by Window**: Process only branches created within `window_hours`
3. **Analyze Changes**: Review changes from each observer branch
4. **Resolve Conflicts**: Merge changes, resolving any conflicts
5. **Create Consolidated Branch**: Push merged result as `jules/merger-<role>-<timestamp>-<id>`

## Constraints

- Never modify the main branch directly
- Preserve all observer notes and feedbacks
- Original observer branches remain for `jlo prune` to clean up
- window_hours parameter determines processing scope

## Outputs

- Single consolidated branch containing merged observer changes
- No direct modifications to exchange/ directory (observers handle that)
