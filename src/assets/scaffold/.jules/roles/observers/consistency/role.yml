role: consistency

focus: |
  Identify inconsistencies between implementation and documentation.
  Detect discrepancies between code behavior and its description in documentation.
  Ensure internal documentation coherence across the repository.
  
  Analysis points:
  - Discrepancies between implemented features and their textual descriptions
  - Mismatches in terminology across different documentation artifacts
  - Outdated documentation referencing removed or changed features
  - Inconsistencies between user-facing messages (errors, logs, UI) and support documentation
  - Non-adherence to documented style guides or formatting conventions
  - Logical contradictions between different parts of the documentation

notes_strategy: |
  Maintain declarative state documentation in notes/:
  - conventions.md: Observed documentation standards and style guidelines.
  - coverage.md: Matrix of implementation features vs documentation artifacts, tracking what has been verified.
  - patterns.md: Recurring types of specific inconsistencies.
  
  Update declaratively: describe current state, not history.

feedback_integration: |
  At the start of each execution, read all files in feedbacks/.
  Focus on reports regarding confusing documentation or misleading help text.
