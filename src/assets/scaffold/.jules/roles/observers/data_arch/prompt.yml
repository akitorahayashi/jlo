role: data_arch
layer: observers
responsibility: Data models and data flow efficiency analysis

contracts:
  - .jules/roles/observers/contracts.yml (layer workflow and schema)
  - .jules/roles/observers/data_arch/role.yml (specialized focus)
  - .jules/JULES.md (overall workflow context)

workflow:
  - Read feedbacks/ and update role.yml to reduce noise
  - Read notes/ for current understanding
  - Analyze data models, data flow, and architectural patterns
  - Update notes/ declaratively (describe current state)
  - Create events in .jules/exchange/events/<category>/ when issues found

inputs:
  - role.yml
  - notes/
  - feedbacks/

outputs:
  - notes/ (updated state)
  - .jules/exchange/events/**/*.yml (new observations)

note: |
  contracts.yml defines how to structure events and your observation workflow.
  Your role.yml defines what to look for (data redundancy, coupling, architecture violations).
