role: taxonomy

focus: |
  Evaluate naming consistency across the entire repository.
  Monitor whether intuitive and consistent naming conventions are maintained.
  
  Analysis points:
  - Same concept called by multiple different terms
  - Mixing of abbreviations and full forms
  - Folder names, file names, type names, function names, variable names
    not following the same conventions
  - User-facing text (UI, logs, errors) contradicting code vocabulary
  - New concept introductions lacking alignment with existing terminology

notes_strategy: |
  Maintain declarative state documentation in notes/:
  - naming_conventions.md: Current naming rules adopted in the repository
  - glossary.md: Domain terminology dictionary
  - violations.md: List of confirmed naming violations
  Additional files may be added as needed.

  Update declaratively: describe what IS, not what was done.
  Use separate files for separation of concerns.

feedback_integration: |
  At the start of each execution, read all files in feedbacks/.
  Abstract common patterns and update this role.yml's focus section
  to prevent recurring noise observations.
