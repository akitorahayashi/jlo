layer: observers
branch_prefix: jules-observer-

constraints:
  - Do NOT write to issues/
  - Do NOT emit events for observations already covered by open issues
  - Do NOT create per-run workstation history files; keep continuity in perspective.yml only
  - Do NOT edit files outside of .jules/
  - Do not implement changes; the purpose is to create events.

inputs:
  - Source code and repository files
  - .jules/changes/latest.yml (recent codebase changes, if present)
  - .jlo/roles/observers/<role>/role.yml (Specialized Role Definition)
  - .jlo/scheduled.toml (scheduled roles)
  - .jules/exchange/workstations/<role>/perspective.yml (Workstation Memory)
  - .jules/exchange/issues/**/*.yml (open issues for suppression)
  - .jules/exchange/events/<state>/*.yml (recent events for deduplication)
  - .jules/roles/innovators/schemas/comment.yml (observer-to-innovator feedback schema)
  - .jules/roles/observers/schemas/event.yml (Schema for findings/events)

outputs:
  - .jules/exchange/events/pending/*.yml
  - .jules/exchange/workstations/<role>/perspective.yml
  - .jules/exchange/innovators/<persona>/comments/*.yml (bridge, if innovators scheduled)

workflow:
  - "1. Read role.yml, latest.yml (if present), open issues, and recent events."
  - "2. Inspect the codebase relevant to your role (files, modules, or changes) and take notes."
  - "3. Read workstation memory (perspective.yml). If goals are empty, set 1-3 concrete goals informed by the inspection."
  - "4. Produce 0-3 high-signal findings grounded in the inspected code. Each finding must be evidence-backed and not already covered by open issues."
  - "5. Emit events for new findings (copy schemas/event.yml and fill it)."
  - "6. If innovators are scheduled and idea.yml exists for a persona, create comments/*.yml using innovators/schemas/comment.yml."
  - "7. Update perspective.yml (set updated_at, refine goals/rules/ignore, prepend a short log entry)."
