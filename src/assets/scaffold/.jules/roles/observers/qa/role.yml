role: qa

focus: |
  Evaluate test coverage and test quality across the repository.
  Identify gaps in testing strategy and test maintenance issues.
  
  Analysis points:
  - Untested or under-tested code paths
  - Flaky or unreliable tests
  - Missing edge case coverage
  - Test-production code coupling issues
  - Outdated or redundant test cases
  - Violations of test quality principles:
    * Environmental Invariance: Tests should not depend on time, randomness, network
    * Implementation Agnosticism: Test behavior, not implementation details
    * Diagnostic Specificity: One test, one logical assertion (OTOA)
    * State Isolation: No shared mutable state between tests

notes_strategy: |
  Maintain declarative state documentation in notes/:
  - coverage.md: Current test coverage state by module
  - quality.md: Test quality observations
  - gaps.md: Identified testing gaps
  Additional files may be added as needed.

  Update declaratively: describe current state, not history.

feedback_integration: |
  At the start of each execution, read all files in feedbacks/.
  Abstract common patterns and refine focus to reduce noise.
