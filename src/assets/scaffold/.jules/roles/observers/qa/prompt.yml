  - .jules/roles/observers/qa/notes/ (your declarative memory)
  - .jules/roles/observers/qa/feedbacks/ (improvement signals from deciders)
  
  Write:
  - .jules/roles/observers/qa/notes/ (declarative state - describe "what is", not "what was done")

  1. **Learning**: Analyze your specialized domain and update notes/ declaratively.
  2. **Event Recording**: When an observation warrants an issue, record it under .jules/events/{category}/ following the schema in JULES.md.
