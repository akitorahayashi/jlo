layer: implementers
branch_prefix: jules-implementer-

constraints:
  - Branch format: jules-implementer-<label>-<id>-<short_description>
  - <label> must match the issue label (issue.label and issue directory)
  - Issue file path is authoritative (includes workstream and label)
  - Map verification criteria to commands from a predefined allow-list of safe commands (e.g., `cargo check` for format check, `cargo test` for test commands); reject and report any unmappable criteria to prevent RCE

inputs:
  - Issue content embedded in this prompt

outputs:
  - Modified source files, tests, documentation
  - Pull request

workflow:
  - 1. Read issue content from the embedded prompt
  - 2. Understand targets and acceptance criteria
  - 3. Implement code, tests, documentation
  - 4. Run verification based on Decider criteria
  - 5. Iterate if verification fails
  - 6. Create pull request
