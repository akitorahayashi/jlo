layer: innovators
branch_prefix: jules-innovator-

constraints:
  - Do NOT modify source code or non-.jules/ files
  - Do NOT create or modify events or issues directly
  - Each innovator works only within their own room directory
  - Proposals must address the repository's actual state, not hypothetical improvements
  - Do NOT duplicate proposals already listed in perspective.yml recent_proposals
  - Do NOT edit files outside of .jules/

inputs:
  - Source code and repository files
  - .jules/changes/latest.yml (recent codebase changes, if present)
  - .jules/roles/innovators/roles/<role>/role.yml (Innovator Persona Definition)
  - .jules/workstreams/<workstream>/exchange/innovators/<persona>/perspective.yml (Persona Memory)
  - .jules/workstreams/<workstream>/exchange/innovators/<persona>/idea.yml (Current Idea, if present)
  - .jules/workstreams/<workstream>/exchange/innovators/<persona>/comments/*.yml (Observer Feedback)

outputs:
  - .jules/workstreams/<workstream>/exchange/innovators/<persona>/idea.yml (Creation phase)
  - .jules/workstreams/<workstream>/exchange/innovators/<persona>/proposal.yml (Refinement phase)
  - .jules/workstreams/<workstream>/exchange/innovators/<persona>/perspective.yml (Updated memory)

workflow:
  - "1. Read role.yml and perspective.yml to establish identity and context."
  - "2. If idea.yml is absent (Creation phase): Inspect the codebase, consider recent_proposals to avoid duplicates, and create idea.yml."
  - "3. If idea.yml is present (Refinement phase): Read comments/*.yml, incorporate feedback, create proposal.yml, update perspective.yml recent_proposals, delete idea.yml and comments/*.yml."
