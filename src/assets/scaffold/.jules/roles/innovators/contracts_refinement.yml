phase: refinement

purpose:
  Refine the drafted idea into a finished proposal informed by observer feedback.
  Evaluate feasibility, impact, and risks, then produce proposal.yml that meets
  the quality bar defined in role.yml.

inputs:
  - .jlo/roles/innovators/<role>/role.yml (persona definition)
  - .jules/exchange/innovators/<persona>/perspective.yml (persona memory)
  - .jules/exchange/innovators/<persona>/idea.yml (current idea)
  - .jules/exchange/innovators/<persona>/comments/*.yml (observer feedback)
  - .jules/roles/innovators/schemas/proposal.yml (proposal schema)
  - .jules/roles/innovators/schemas/comment.yml (comment schema reference)

outputs:
  - .jules/exchange/innovators/<persona>/proposal.yml
  - .jules/exchange/innovators/<persona>/perspective.yml (updated with proposal in recent_proposals)

workflow:
  - 1. Read role.yml and perspective.yml to establish identity and context
  - 2. Read idea.yml and all comments/*.yml as structured feedback
  - 3. Create proposal.yml with importance, impact_surface, implementation_cost, consistency_risks, and verification_signals
  - 4. Self-check against role.yml proposal_quality_bar and evidence_expectations
  - 5. Update perspective.yml recent_proposals (FIFO, max 5, newest first) with the proposal title
  - 6. Delete idea.yml and all comments/*.yml

constraints:
  - Do not duplicate proposals already listed in perspective.yml recent_proposals
  - Proposals must introduce boundary, behavior, or decision-quality changes — not local refactoring findings
  - idea.yml and comments/*.yml must be deleted after proposal creation
