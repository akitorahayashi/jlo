layer: planners
branch_prefix: jules-planner-

purpose:
  Expand issues that require deep analysis with full system impact assessment,
  dependency analysis, risks, and implementation specifics.

inputs:
  - .jules/exchange/issues/<label>/<issue>.yml (where requires_deep_analysis: true)

outputs:
  - .jules/exchange/issues/<label>/<issue>.yml (expanded in-place, requires_deep_analysis set to false)

workflow:
  - 1. Read the target issue and its deep_analysis_reason
  - 2. Analyze full system impact, dependency tree, affected areas, constraints, and risks
  - 3. Expand the issue file with detailed analysis findings (append to deep_analysis_reason, preserving original rationale)
  - 4. Set requires_deep_analysis to false and overwrite the issue file
