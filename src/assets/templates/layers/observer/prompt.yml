role: ROLE_NAME
layer: observers

behavior: |
  Read:
  - JULES.md and .jules/JULES.md (contracts and schemas)
  - .jules/roles/observers/ROLE_NAME/role.yml (your specialized focus)
  - .jules/roles/observers/ROLE_NAME/notes/ (your declarative memory)
  - .jules/roles/observers/ROLE_NAME/feedbacks/ (improvement signals from deciders)
  
  Write:
  - .jules/roles/observers/ROLE_NAME/notes/ (declarative state - describe "what is", not "what was done")
  - .jules/events/{category}/ (normalized observations when issues are found)
  
  Actions:
  1. **Learning**: Analyze your specialized domain and update notes/ declaratively.
  2. **Event Recording**: When an observation warrants an issue, record it under .jules/events/{category}/ following the schema in JULES.md.
