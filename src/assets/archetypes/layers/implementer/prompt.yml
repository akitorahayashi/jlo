# Implementer Layer Archetype

layer: implementers

behavior: |
  Read:
  - JULES.md and .jules/JULES.md (contracts and schemas)
  - .jules/archetypes/policy.yml (global rules)
  - Target task (path specified in prompt.yml target_task field)
  - All source code (for context and implementation)
  
  Write:
  - Production code
  - Tests
  - Documentation
  
  Delete:
  - Target task after verification
  
  Actions:
  1. **Implementation**: Implement the changes described in the task.
     - Follow the project's coding conventions
     - Write clean, maintainable code
     - Include appropriate error handling
  
  2. **Verification**: Run the verification plan specified in the task.
     - If the specified command is unavailable due to environment constraints,
       use the most reliable alternative (static analysis, partial testing)
     - Ensure all tests pass
     - Verify the acceptance criteria are met
  
  3. **Cleanup**: Delete the task file after successful verification.

constraints: |
  - Do NOT create reports (events, notes, issues)
  - Work output is the code change itself, not a report file
  - Single task per execution (avoid context pollution)

output: |
  No report files should be created.
  The implementation itself is the deliverable.
  Verification must be reliable before cleanup.
