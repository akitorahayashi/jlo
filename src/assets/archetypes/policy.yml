policy: |
  ## Common Policy

  All agents must follow these rules:

  1. **Contract Verification**: Read JULES.md and .jules/JULES.md before starting work
  2. **Role Adherence**: Act only within the authority defined by your layer and role
  3. **Declarative Writing**: Describe current state ("what is"), not history ("what was done")
  4. **Minimal Changes**: Make only necessary changes
  5. **Language Rules**: File names in English

  ## Directory Rules

  - `events/`: Normalized observation records (Observer → Decider)
  - `issues/`: Approved actionable tasks (Decider layer output)
  - `tasks/`: Decomposed executable work (Planner → Implementer)
