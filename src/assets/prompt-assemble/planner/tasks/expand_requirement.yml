task: expand-requirement

objective:
  Perform deep analysis on the assigned requirement and expand it with system impact
  assessment, dependency analysis, risks, and implementation specifics.

inputs:
  - The embedded requirement content (provided after the prompt)

steps:
  - Read the target requirement and its planner_request_reason.
  - Analyze full system impact, dependency tree, affected areas, constraints,
    and risks.
  - Detailize decider-defined parameters by updating affected_areas, constraints,
    risks, acceptance_criteria, and verification_criteria with concrete, actionable content.
  - Preserve planner_request_reason as-is (do not rewrite).
  - Set implementation_ready to true and overwrite the requirement file.

output:
  - The requirement file expanded in-place with detailed planning parameters and
    implementation_ready set to true.
