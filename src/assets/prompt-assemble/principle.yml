rules:
  - "Code dictates the Execution (How): Production code is the mechanical truth. It must clearly and efficiently express the logic, algorithms, and control flow required to accomplish a task."
  - "Tests define the Specification (What): Test suites act as executable documentation. They define the system's expected behaviors, business requirements, and boundaries without focusing on internal implementation details."
  - "Comments capture the Rationale (Why Not): Comments should never duplicate what the code already says. They exist solely to preserve invisible context—explaining technical constraints, trade-offs, edge-case reasoning, and the discarded alternatives that led to a specific decision."

design:
  - "When adding new features or refactoring, removing old modules and deprecated features is mandatory. Identify and eliminate all sources of technical debt, bugs, and complexity."
  - "Never define class or file names with ambiguous responsibilities, such as base, common, core, utils, or helpers."
  - "Every file and class name must identify its single, specific responsibility. Names that merely restate a package or directory scope attract unrelated concerns and become \"God Classes.\""
  - "Never hardcode enumerable values. Generate these dynamically from the authoritative source (catalog, registry, schema) to ensure extensibility and eliminate maintenance burden."
  - "Silent fallbacks are not recommended. Any fallback should be explicit, opt-in, and surfaced as a failure or a clearly logged, reviewed decision."
  - "Prioritize UX simplicity over explicit configuration."
  - "Prefer systemic fixes over patches: consider the invariant and owning component first, then fix it at that boundary so all call sites benefit, without adding workaround paths."

documentation:
  - "All development-related documentation must be written in English."
  - "Keep documentation for LLM (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.) concise for token efficiency. Focus on essential information only."
  - "Documentation is written in a declarative style describing the current state. Imperative or changelog-style descriptions are avoided."
  - "Declarative updates preserve existing, correct content and integrate new content where appropriate, without duplication. Avoid ripping and replacing everything."
  - "Avoid using ** to emphasize something in Markdown. Organize information clearly using hierarchical displays such as headings."
