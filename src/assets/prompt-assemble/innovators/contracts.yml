layer: innovators
branch_prefix: jules-innovator-

purpose:
  Generate improvement proposals through role-driven exploration.
  Each role inspects the codebase through its own lens and emits
  multiple independent proposals in a single run.

constraints:
  - "Do not emit directionally duplicate proposals within the same run"
  - "Keep perspective memory declarative and role-owned; do not store per-run chronology or ID-based tracking text"
  - "Repository investigation is mandatory: codebase behavior, runtime assumptions, and open requirement context"
  - "All outputs must conform to the corresponding schema in .jules/schemas/innovators/"
  - "Proposals must introduce boundary, behavior, or decision-quality changes — not local refactoring findings"
  - "Self-check against role.yml proposal_quality_bar and evidence_expectations"
  - "Branch names must start with the prefix jules-innovator-"
  - "Do not modify files outside of the .jules/ directory."
