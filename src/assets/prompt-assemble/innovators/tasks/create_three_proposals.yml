task: create_three_proposals
mode: direct

objective:
  Generate exactly three independent, high-leverage intervention proposals.

steps:
  - Inspect repository behavior, boundaries, and runtime assumptions within the prepared analysis scope.
  - Generate exactly three proposals with clearly different directions and non-overlapping core interventions.
  - For each proposal, copy schema with cp .jules/schemas/innovators/proposal.yml .jules/exchange/proposals/<role>-<kebab-case-slug>.yml, then fill all fields.
  - Each proposal must include importance, impact_surface, implementation_cost, consistency_risks, and verification_signals.
  - Do not update perspective.yml in this task.

output:
  - .jules/exchange/proposals/<role>-<kebab-case-slug>.yml (3 files)

constraints:
  - "All proposals must satisfy role.yml proposal_quality_bar and remain within role focus boundary"
  - "The three proposals must have non-overlapping core direction"
  - "Filenames must include role prefix and kebab-case slug to avoid collisions"
  - "If a proposal direction is materially equivalent to another emitted proposal, fail explicitly instead of emitting overlapping files"
