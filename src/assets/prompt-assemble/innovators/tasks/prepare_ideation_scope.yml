title: Prepare Ideation Scope

description:
  Read role memory and define the analytical scope used for this innovator run.

steps:
  - "Read perspective.yml and role.yml."
  - "If perspective.yml is not yet calibrated, derive baseline understanding from role.yml focus/proposal_quality_bar/evidence_expectations and current repository structure."
  - "Build this run's ideation scope from repository_observations and thinking_notes."
  - "Set explicit boundaries for what proposal directions are in-scope vs out-of-scope."
  - "Do not emit proposals or update files in this task."
