title: Refresh Innovator Perspective

description:
  Update perspective.yml as durable decision memory for the next innovator run.

steps:
  - "Run this task on every innovator execution."
  - "Rewrite repository_observations as current-state analytical memory for the next cycle."
  - "Rewrite thinking_notes to preserve active hypotheses, tradeoffs, and rejected paths."
  - "Keep perspective memory declarative and role-owned; do not store per-run chronology, event IDs, or ticket IDs."
  - "Do not modify proposal artifacts in this task."
