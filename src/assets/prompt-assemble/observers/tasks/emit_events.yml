title: Inspect and Emit Events

description:
  Inspect repository state and emit event files for high-signal findings.

steps:
  - "Cross-reference findings against open requirements and recent events to avoid duplication."
  - "For each finding (0-3): copy schema with
    cp .jules/schemas/observers/event.yml .jules/exchange/events/pending/<id>.yml,
    then fill all fields. Each event must have concrete file-level evidence."
