title: Prepare Inspection Scope

description:
  Read role memory and establish this run's inspection scope and signal filter.

steps:
  - "Read perspective.yml and role.yml."
  - "Build an ordered inspection scope from focus_paths; treat it as priority, not an exclusive boundary."
  - "If perspective.yml is not yet calibrated, derive initial scope from role.yml focus/analysis_points and current repository structure."
  - "Derive this run's signal filter from goals, rules, and ignore."
  - "Do not emit events or update files in this task."
