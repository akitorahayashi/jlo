branch_prefix: jules-decider-

purpose:
  Triage observer events into actionable requirements. Verify each event against the
  current codebase, discard stale observations, rationalize conflicts, and
  aggregate valid events into requirements for downstream processing.

constraints:
  - "Requirement filenames use kebab-case title; IDs are 6-char random lowercase alphanumeric"
  - "Each decided event ID belongs to at most one requirement source_events list at a time"
  - "When implementation_ready is false, planner_request_reason must be non-empty"
  - "verification_criteria must be clear and actionable"
  - "Branch names must start with the prefix jules-decider-"
  - "Do not modify files outside of the .jules/ directory."
