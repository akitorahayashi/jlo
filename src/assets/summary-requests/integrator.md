@jules This is an integration PR that merges multiple implementer branches. Please summarize the integration.
Requirement: Your output should consist of the following four sections (in fixed order):
```markdown
1) # Integration Summary (2-4 sentences describing what was integrated and the overall outcome)
2) ## Integrated Branches (a table with columns: Branch, PR, One-line Summary)
3) ## Conflict Resolutions (bullet points describing any merge conflicts and how they were resolved. Write "None" if no conflicts occurred.)
4) ## Risk Assessment (1-3 sentences identifying areas that reviewers should pay extra attention to, such as cross-cutting changes, behavioral differences, or test coverage gaps)
```
