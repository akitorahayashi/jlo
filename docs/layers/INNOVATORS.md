# Innovator Role Guide

The **Innovators** layer is responsible for proposing, refining, and preparing new features or architectural changes. Innovators work iteratively, leveraging feedback from Observers to ensure proposals are robust and consistent with project standards.

## Purpose

Innovators bridge the gap between abstract ideas and concrete requirements. They generate structured proposals that define the problem, solution, and impact, ensuring that changes are well-thought-out before implementation.

## Roles

Innovators are categorized by their area of focus:

- **Experience**:
  - `cli_seeder`: Specializes in CLI usability and onboarding experiences.
- **Strategy**:
  - `leverage_architect`: Focuses on system scalability and architectural leverage.
  - `recruiter`: Identifies and defines new roles or capabilities needed by the system.

## Inputs

- **User Intent**: The problem or feature request provided via the prompt.
- **Codebase Context**: Existing files relevant to the proposal.
- **Observer Feedback**: Comments generated by Observers on previous iterations (found in `comments/`).

## Outputs

- **Idea (`idea.yml`)**: A preliminary sketch of the proposal, used to gather feedback.
- **Proposal (`proposal.yml`)**: The final, structured definition of the change, ready for review.

## Execution

Innovators are executed via the CLI, specifying the role (persona) and task:

```bash
jlo run innovators --role <persona> --task <task_name>
```

Example:
```bash
jlo run innovators --role recruiter --task create_idea
```

### Tasks

The Innovator workflow is task-driven:

1. **`create_idea`**:
   - Generates an `idea.yml` file describing the core concept.
   - This file is committed to `.jules/exchange/innovators/<persona>/`.

2. **`refine_idea_and_create_proposal`**:
   - Reads the existing `idea.yml` and any observer comments in `comments/`.
   - Incorporates feedback to address risks or improve the design.
   - Replaces `idea.yml` with a detailed `proposal.yml`.

3. **`create_proposal`**:
   - Directly creates a `proposal.yml` without an intermediate idea phase.
   - Useful for simple or urgent changes where feedback loops are skipped.

## Workflow

1. **Ideation**:
   - The user triggers an Innovator with `create_idea`.
   - The Innovator produces `idea.yml`.

2. **Feedback Loop (Optional but Recommended)**:
   - Observers run (e.g., `jlo run observers --role structural_arch`).
   - Observers analyze the `idea.yml` and add comments to `comments/`.

3. **Refinement**:
   - The user triggers the Innovator with `refine_idea_and_create_proposal`.
   - The Innovator synthesizes the original idea and observer feedback into a final `proposal.yml`.
   - The `idea.yml` file is removed.

4. **Review**:
   - The proposal is reviewed (often by a human or a high-level Decider).
   - If accepted, it becomes a Requirement for implementation.

## Schemas

### Idea Schema (`innovator_idea.yml`)
Represents a draft concept.
- `id`: Unique identifier.
- `persona`: The authoring role.
- `title`: Short name of the idea.
- `problem`: What problem does this solve?
- `introduction`: Brief overview.
- `expected_value`: Why is this valuable?

### Proposal Schema (`proposal.yml`)
Represents a formal change request.
- `id`: Unique identifier.
- `persona`: The authoring role.
- `title`: Short name of the proposal.
- `problem`: Detailed problem statement.
- `introduction`: Comprehensive overview.
- `importance`: Strategic value.
- `impact_surface`: List of affected components (e.g., "workflow", "cli").
- `implementation_cost`: `low`, `medium`, or `high`.
- `consistency_risks`: Potential conflicts or downsides.
- `verification_signals`: How will we know if this succeeds?
