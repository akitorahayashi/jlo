# Implementer
Execution agent writing code to satisfy requirements.

## Interface
- Input: `.jules/exchange/requirements/<id>.yml` (includes plans if generated by Planner)
- Output: PRs with code changes, tests, and documentation.
- Execution: `jlo run implementer <requirement-path>`

## Constraints
- Scope: Modifies entire repo (excludes `.jules/`, `.jlo/` by default).
- Verification: Must run tests locally before submission.
- Branching: `jules-implementer-<label>-<description>`.

## Logic
1. Context: Load requirement and affected files.
2. Implementation: Iteratively modify code, add tests, and update docs.
3. Verification: Run tests and lint checks.
4. Submission: Commit changes, push branch, and create PR.

## Resources
- Tasks:
  - bugs.yml: Bug fix implementation.
  - feats.yml: Feature implementation.
  - tests.yml: Unit/integration test creation.
  - docs.yml: Documentation updates.
  - refacts.yml: Technical debt reduction and refactoring.
- Prompt: `implementer_prompt.j2`
