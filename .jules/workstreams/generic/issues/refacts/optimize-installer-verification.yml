summary: "Add path filtering to verify-installers workflow."

# Content
problem: |
  The `verify-installers.yml` workflow runs on every pull request without path filtering.
  It executes expensive setup steps even for changes unrelated to the installer catalog.

impact: |
  Wastes CI compute resources and slows down feedback for developers working on other parts of the system.

desired_outcome: |
  The workflow only triggers when files in `src/assets/catalog/` (or related paths) are modified.

# Specifics
affected_areas:
  - ".github/workflows/verify-installers.yml"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "Update `.github/workflows/verify-installers.yml` to include `paths` filter for `src/assets/catalog/**`."

verification_commands:
  - "cat .github/workflows/verify-installers.yml"
