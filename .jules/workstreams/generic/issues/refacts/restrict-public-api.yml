title: Restrict Public API Surface in lib.rs
label: refacts
priority: medium
summary: "Reduce public exports in lib.rs to protect internal layers."
problem: |
  The `src/lib.rs` file indiscriminately exports internal modules (`app`, `services`, `ports`) as public. This violates encapsulation and exposes implementation details to consumers.
impact: |
  Consumers might couple to internal details, making future refactoring breaking changes.
desired_outcome: |
  Only the intended public API is exposed.
affected_areas:
  - "src/lib.rs"
  - "src/main.rs"
acceptance_criteria:
  - "Modify `src/lib.rs` to only export the necessary public API (if any)."
  - "Ensure `main.rs` can still access what it needs."
verification_commands:
  - "cargo check"
  - "cargo doc --no-deps --open"
requires_deep_analysis: false
