title: "Fix Inconsistent Service Naming and Structure"
label: "refacts"
priority: "medium"
summary: "Standardize service naming and structure in src/services/."

# Content
problem: |
  Services in `src/services/` exhibit inconsistent naming conventions (some use prefix, some suffix, e.g. `jules_client_http` vs `HttpJulesClient`) and structural patterns (some are structs, others are modules of functions).

impact: |
  Inconsistency increases cognitive load for developers and makes the codebase harder to navigate.
  It violates the principle of consistent naming shapes across boundaries.

desired_outcome: |
  Services follow a consistent pattern.
  Struct names match filenames (e.g. `JulesClientHttp` or rename file to `http_jules_client.rs`).
  Services managing state or config are implemented as structs.

# Specifics
affected_areas:
  - "src/services/"
  - "src/services/jules_client_http.rs"
  - "src/services/scaffold_assets.rs"
  - "src/services/embedded_role_template_store.rs"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "Rename `HttpJulesClient` to match filename or vice versa."
  - "Refactor function-only modules like `scaffold_assets.rs` to use structs if they maintain state or configuration."
  - "Align `EmbeddedRoleTemplateStore` vocabulary (Scaffold vs Template)."

verification_commands:
  - "cargo test"
  - "cargo check"
