title: "Clarify Domain Terminology"
label: "refacts"
priority: "low"
summary: "Ambiguous terms (Setup/Install, Scaffold/Template/Managed Defaults) and config mismatches need rationalization."

# Content
problem: |
  Multiple terminological inconsistencies exist:
  1. `SetupConfig` struct maps to `tools.yml` (naming mismatch).
  2. `setup` command generates `install.sh` (verb mismatch).
  3. "Managed Defaults", "Scaffold", and "Templates" are used interchangeably across services and CLI help.

impact: |
  Conceptual confusion makes it difficult to reason about the system's behavior and communicate about features.

desired_outcome: |
  Terminology is consistent across code, configuration, and user-facing artifacts.

# Specifics
affected_areas:
  - "src/domain/setup.rs"
  - "src/services/managed_defaults.rs"
  - "src/app/commands/setup/"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "`SetupConfig` renamed to match config file (e.g. `ToolsConfig`)."
  - "Ambiguity between `setup` command and `install.sh` artifact resolved."
  - "Unified vocabulary established for 'Managed Defaults' vs 'Scaffold'."

verification_commands:
  - "grep -r 'SetupConfig' src/"
  - "grep -r 'ManagedDefaults' src/"
