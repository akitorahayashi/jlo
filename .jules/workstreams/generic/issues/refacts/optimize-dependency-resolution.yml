title: "Optimize Dependency Resolution Performance"
label: "refacts"
priority: "low"
summary: "Improve the performance of `Resolver::resolve` by reducing unnecessary cloning."

# Content
problem: |
  The `Resolver::resolve` method in `src/services/resolver.rs` inefficiently clones entire `Component` structs, including script content, to perform topological sorting. This creates unnecessary memory pressure and slows down resolution for large catalogs.

impact: |
  - Performance degradation as the component catalog grows.
  - Higher memory usage.

desired_outcome: |
  - `Resolver::resolve` uses references or lightweight identifiers (e.g., `&str` or indices) for sorting.
  - Cloning is minimized or eliminated during the sort phase.
