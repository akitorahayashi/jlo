summary: "The `jlo update` command supports an `--adopt-managed` flag that is not documented in README.md."

# Content

  The `jlo update` command implementation supports an `--adopt-managed` flag (verified in `src/app/commands/update.rs`), but this option is not listed in the `README.md` command reference.

impact: |
  Users are unaware of the ability to adopt managed defaults during updates, potentially leading to manual effort or inconsistent states.

desired_outcome: |
  `README.md` accurately documents the `--adopt-managed` flag for the update command.
