title: "Fix Documentation and CLI Inconsistencies"
label: "docs"
priority: "medium"
summary: "Resolve discrepancies between documentation, CLI help text, and actual implementation behavior."

# Content
problem: |
  There are numerous inconsistencies between the documentation (README, AGENTS.md), CLI help text, and the actual code:
  - **API URL**: `jules.googleapis.com` (code) vs `jules.ai` (docs).
  - **CLI Help**: `jlo template` help lists all layers, but code forbids single-role layers.
  - **AGENTS.md**: Lists removed dependencies (`arboard`) and misses new ones (`reqwest`, `serde_json`, `url`).
  - **Undocumented Flags**: `jlo update --adopt-managed` is undocumented.
  - **Terminology**: "Scaffold" vs "Template" usage is overloaded and confusing.
  - **Ambiguity**: `setup` command generates `install.sh`, creating confusion.

impact: |
  - Users are misled by incorrect documentation and help text.
  - Developers are confused by ambiguous terminology.
  - Maintainers struggle to keep track of dependencies and features.

desired_outcome: |
  - Documentation accurately reflects the code.
  - CLI help text is accurate.
  - Terminology is standardized and clarified in docs.
  - `setup` command artifacts are clearly described or command is renamed (if appropriate, or just documented clearly).
