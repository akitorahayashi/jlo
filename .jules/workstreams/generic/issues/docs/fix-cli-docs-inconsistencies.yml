label: "docs"
priority: "low"
summary: "Correct CLI examples for schedule export and workstreams inspect."

# Content
problem: |
  Both `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` document `jlo schedule export` and `jlo workstreams inspect` as runnable commands without arguments.
  However, the implementation requires a `--scope` argument for the former and `--workstream` for the latter.

impact: |
  Users following the documentation will encounter errors.
  Automated agents might fail if they rely on the documented examples.

desired_outcome: |
  Documentation examples are correct, runnable, and reflect the mandatory arguments.

# Specifics
affected_areas:
  - "README.md"
  - "AGENTS.md"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "`README.md` and `AGENTS.md` examples for `jlo schedule export` include `--scope`."
  - "`README.md` and `AGENTS.md` examples for `jlo workstreams inspect` include `--workstream`."

verification_commands:
  - "grep 'schedule export' AGENTS.md"
  - "grep 'workstreams inspect' AGENTS.md"
