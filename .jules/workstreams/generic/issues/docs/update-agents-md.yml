title: Update AGENTS.md to reflect current dependencies and project structure
label: docs
priority: medium
summary: "Sync AGENTS.md with actual Cargo.toml dependencies and remove obsolete clipboard references."
problem: |
  The `AGENTS.md` file contains outdated information regarding the project's technology stack and structure. Specifically:
  1. The "Tech Stack" section omits key dependencies present in `Cargo.toml`, such as `reqwest`, `serde_json`, and `url`.
  2. The file references removed clipboard functionality (`arboard` dependency and `clipboard_arboard` service) which are no longer in the codebase.
impact: |
  Misleading documentation confuses new contributors and agents, leading to hallucinations about available tools or architecture.
desired_outcome: |
  `AGENTS.md` accurately reflects the current state of the codebase, including correct dependencies and service structure.
affected_areas:
  - "AGENTS.md"
acceptance_criteria:
  - "Add `reqwest`, `serde_json`, and `url` to the Tech Stack section in `AGENTS.md`."
  - "Remove references to `arboard` and `clipboard_arboard` from `AGENTS.md`."
verification_commands:
  - "grep 'reqwest' AGENTS.md"
  - "grep 'serde_json' AGENTS.md"
  - "! grep 'arboard' AGENTS.md"
