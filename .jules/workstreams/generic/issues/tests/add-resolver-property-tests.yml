title: Add Property-Based Tests for Resolver
label: tests
priority: medium
summary: "Add proptest to verify resolver correctness."
problem: |
  The `Resolver` service relies on limited manual unit tests. Property-based tests are needed to ensure correctness of topological sorting and cycle detection.
impact: |
  Potential edge cases in dependency resolution could be missed.
desired_outcome: |
  Robust tests covering random graphs.
affected_areas:
  - "src/services/resolver.rs"
acceptance_criteria:
  - "Add `proptest` dependency."
  - "Implement property-based tests for `Resolver::resolve` generating random dependency graphs."
verification_commands:
  - "grep 'proptest' src/services/resolver.rs"
requires_deep_analysis: false
deep_analysis_reason: ""
