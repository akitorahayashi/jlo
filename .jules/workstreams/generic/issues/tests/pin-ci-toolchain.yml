title: Pin CI Toolchain Version
label: tests
priority: high
summary: "Ensure CI uses the same pinned toolchain as release."
problem: |
  CI workflows use `stable` (floating), while release uses `1.90.0` (pinned). This creates drift and reproducibility risks.
impact: |
  Code might pass CI but fail release or runtime.
desired_outcome: |
  Consistent toolchain across all workflows.
affected_areas:
  - ".github/actions/setup/action.yml"
acceptance_criteria:
  - "Update `.github/actions/setup/action.yml` to use a pinned Rust version (ideally `1.90.0` to match release, or update release to match)."
  - "Ensure consistent toolchain usage across CI and Release."
verification_commands:
  - "grep '1.90.0' .github/actions/setup/action.yml"
