summary: "Validate all platforms in CI and promote artifacts in Release."

# Content
problem: |
  CI currently only validates the Linux x86_64 target.
  The release workflow rebuilds binaries for macOS and ARM targets instead of promoting tested artifacts, leading to potential discrepancies and lack of validation for non-Linux platforms.

impact: |
  Platform-specific issues may only be detected during or after release.
  The release process is slower and less reproducible due to rebuilding.

desired_outcome: |
  CI builds and tests all supported targets (Linux x86_64, Linux ARM64, macOS x86_64, macOS ARM64).
  The release workflow downloads these pre-built artifacts instead of rebuilding them.

acceptance_criteria:
  - "Update `build.yml` to include macOS and ARM targets in the matrix."
  - "Update `release.yml` to download artifacts for all platforms."
  - "Remove redundant build steps in `release.yml`."

  - "cat .github/workflows/build.yml"
