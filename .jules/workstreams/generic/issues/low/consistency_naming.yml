title: "Naming Inconsistencies"
priority: "low"
summary: "Inconsistent naming between Ports and Adapter implementations."

# Content
problem: |
  Several ports in `src/ports/` have implementations in `src/services/` with inconsistent naming:
  - `JulesClient` -> `HttpJulesClient` (in `jules_api.rs`)
  - `ClipboardWriter` -> `ArboardClipboard` (in `clipboard_arboard.rs`)
  - `ComponentCatalog` -> `EmbeddedCatalog` (in `catalog.rs`)

impact: |
  - Makes it harder to find the implementation for a given port.
  - Violates the Principle of Least Surprise.

desired_outcome: |
  - Adapter names and filenames are consistent with their Ports (e.g. `JulesClient` -> `JulesClientImpl` or `HttpJulesClient` in `jules_client_http.rs`).
