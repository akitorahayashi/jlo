title: "Naming Inconsistencies and Missing Templates"
priority: "low"
summary: "The codebase has inconsistent layer naming (singular vs plural), filename mismatches, and missing templates for single-role layers."

problem: |
  Several inconsistencies exist in naming and structure:
  1. Layer directories in `src/assets/templates/layers/` use singular (e.g., `observer`), while `Layer` enum and `.jules/roles/` use plural (`Observers`).
  2. `src/services/role_template_service.rs` defines `EmbeddedRoleTemplateStore`, creating a filename/struct mismatch.
  3. `Planners` and `Implementers` layers are defined but lack template directories in `src/assets/templates/layers/`.

impact: |
  Causes confusion during development and navigation. Inconsistent conventions make automation harder.

desired_outcome: |
  - Rename `src/assets/templates/layers/` directories to match plural convention (or decide on singular everywhere).
  - Rename `role_template_service.rs` to `embedded_role_template_store.rs` or rename the struct.
  - Add missing templates for `planners` and `implementers`.
