id: "d4f9j2"
fingerprint: "d4f9j2"
title: "Inconsistent and Outdated Documentation"
priority: "medium"
summary: "Documentation (README.md) is out of sync with codebase capabilities (commands, assets)."

# Content
problem: |
  1. The `workstream` command (alias `w`) is fully implemented but missing from the `README.md` command list.
  2. The `README.md` references workflow templates (`jules-workflows.yml`, `jules-automerge.yml`, etc.) that do not exist in `src/assets/templates/workflows/` (only `jules.yml` exists).

impact: |
  - Users are unaware of the `workstream` command.
  - Users cannot set up CI/CD workflows as described in the documentation.

desired_outcome: |
  - `README.md` includes the `workstream` command.
  - `src/assets/templates/workflows/` contains the missing templates OR `README.md` is updated to reflect available assets.
