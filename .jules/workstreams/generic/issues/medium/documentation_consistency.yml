id: "documentation_consistency"
fingerprint: "documentation_consistency"
title: "Inconsistent and Outdated Documentation"
priority: "medium"
summary: "Several discrepancies exist between documentation (README.md, AGENTS.md) and actual codebase structure."

# Content
problem: |
  Documentation contains multiple inaccuracies:
  1. `README.md` references `jules-pipeline.yml` which does not exist (should be `jules-e2e-pipeline.yml`).
  2. `AGENTS.md` lists `jules-invoke` as a component, but it is missing from `.github/actions/`.
  3. `AGENTS.md` lists an incomplete set of services in `src/services/` (missing `clipboard_arboard`, `jules_api`, `role_template_service`, `workspace_filesystem`).
  4. `AGENTS.md` describes a nested prompt hierarchy (Prompt -> Contracts -> JULES) which contradicts the flat list implementation in decider/planner/implementer templates.
  5. `AGENTS.md` claims "Agent execution is orchestrated by GitHub Actions, not jlo", which contradicts the `jlo run` command usage.
  6. `src/assets/templates/layers/observer/prompt.yml` omits `.jules/JULES.md` from its contracts list.

impact: |
  Misleads developers and agents, potentially leading to incorrect usage, implementation assumptions, or confusion about system boundaries.

desired_outcome: |
  Documentation accurately reflects the codebase structure, services, and workflows.

# Specifics
affected_areas:
  - "README.md"
  - "AGENTS.md"
  - "src/assets/templates/layers/observer/prompt.yml"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "`README.md` references `jules-e2e-pipeline.yml` correctly."
  - "`AGENTS.md` removes `jules-invoke` or explains its absence."
  - "`AGENTS.md` lists all services in `src/services/` correctly."
  - "`AGENTS.md` clarifies the prompt hierarchy vs flat list implementation."
  - "`AGENTS.md` clarifies `jlo run` vs GHA orchestration."
  - "`src/assets/templates/layers/observer/prompt.yml` includes `.jules/JULES.md` in contracts."

verification_commands:
  - "grep 'jules-e2e-pipeline.yml' README.md"
  - "grep 'clipboard_arboard' AGENTS.md"
  - "grep '.jules/JULES.md' src/assets/templates/layers/observer/prompt.yml"
