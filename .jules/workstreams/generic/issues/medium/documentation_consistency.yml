id: "tq30lo"
fingerprint: "tq30lo"
title: "Inconsistent and Outdated Documentation"
priority: "medium"
summary: "README.md is out of sync with the codebase (missing commands, wrong workflows)."

# Content
problem: |
  The documentation does not reflect the current state of the codebase.
  1. The `workstream` command (and aliases) is implemented but missing from `README.md`.
  2. `README.md` references workflow templates (`jules-workflows.yml`, etc.) that do not exist in `src/assets/templates/workflows/` (only `jules.yml` exists).

impact: |
  Users are unaware of available functionality (workstreams) and are misled about available CI/CD templates, leading to confusion and setup errors.

desired_outcome: |
  `README.md` should accurately list all available commands.
  `README.md` should only reference existing workflow templates, or the missing templates should be created.
