title: "Fix CLI Template Command Inconsistency"
label: "bugs"
priority: "low"
summary: "CLI help text lists single-role layers for template command, but implementation forbids them."

# Content
problem: |
  The CLI help text for `jlo template` (derived from the `Layer` enum doc comments) lists all layers (Observers, Deciders, Planners, Implementers). However, `src/app/commands/template/command.rs` explicitly forbids template generation for single-role layers (Planners, Implementers), leading to a misleading user experience.

impact: |
  Users may attempt to generate templates for Planners/Implementers based on help text and receive an error, causing frustration.

desired_outcome: |
  The CLI interface accurately reflects the supported capabilities.

  - "CLI help text matches implemented behavior (e.g. by filtering options or clarifying doc comments)."
  - "OR: The error message is improved to clarify that single-role layers do not use user-definable templates."
