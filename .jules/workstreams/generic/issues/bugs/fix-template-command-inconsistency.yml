title: Fix Inconsistency in Template Command Support for Single Role Layers
label: bugs
priority: medium
summary: "Address mismatch between help text and implementation for single-role templates."
problem: |
  The `jlo template` command help text suggests support for all layers (including single-role ones like planners/implementers), but the implementation explicitly blocks them.
impact: |
  Users attempting to create templates for planners or implementers will face unexpected errors despite the help text suggesting it is possible, leading to confusion and frustration.
desired_outcome: |
  Help text and behavior are consistent.
affected_areas:
  - "src/main.rs"
  - "src/app/commands/template/command.rs"
acceptance_criteria:
  - "Decide whether to support single-role templates or not."
  - "If yes, remove the check in `command.rs`."
  - "If no, update the help text in `src/main.rs` to accurately reflect supported layers."
verification_commands:
  - "cargo check"
requires_deep_analysis: false
deep_analysis_reason: ""
