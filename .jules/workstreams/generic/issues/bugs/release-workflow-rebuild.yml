title: Stop Rebuilding Artifacts in Release Workflow
label: bugs
priority: high
summary: "Use verified build artifacts in release workflow instead of recompiling."
problem: |
  The release workflow rebuilds binaries from source instead of using artifacts from the build workflow. This violates 'Ship what you test' and introduces risk.
impact: |
  Risk of shipping different bits than tested.
desired_outcome: |
  Release workflow uses upstream artifacts.
affected_areas:
  - ".github/workflows/release.yml"
acceptance_criteria:
  - "Modify `.github/workflows/release.yml` to download artifacts from the `build` workflow (or a preceding build step) instead of recompiling."
  - "Ensure the released binary is bit-for-bit identical to the verified artifact."
verification_commands:
  - "! grep 'cargo build' .github/workflows/release.yml"
requires_deep_analysis: false
deep_analysis_reason: ""
