# Content
title: "Documentation Inconsistencies"
statement: |
  Several discrepancies exist between the documentation (README.md, AGENTS.md) and the actual codebase structure and implementation. These include incorrect file references, missing component descriptions, incomplete service lists, and inaccurate architectural descriptions.

evidence:
  - path: "README.md"
    loc: "GitHub Actions Integration table"
    note: "References 'jules-pipeline.yml' which does not exist (should be 'jules-e2e-pipeline.yml' or removed)."
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc: "Architecture table"
    note: "Lists 'jules-invoke' component which is missing from '.github/actions/'."
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc: "Project Structure / Services"
    note: "List of services in 'src/services/' is incomplete (missing clipboard_arboard, jules_api, role_template_service, workspace_filesystem)."
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc: "Prompt Hierarchy"
    note: "Describes a nested hierarchy (Prompt -> Contracts -> JULES) which contradicts the flat list implementation in decider/planner/implementer templates, and the observer template omits JULES.md entirely."
  - path: "src/assets/templates/layers/observer/prompt.yml"
    loc: "contracts list"
    note: "Missing reference to global constraints '.jules/JULES.md'."
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc: "Workflow-Driven Execution"
    note: "Claims 'Agent execution is orchestrated by GitHub Actions, not jlo', contradicting the existence of 'jlo run' command and other documentation."
