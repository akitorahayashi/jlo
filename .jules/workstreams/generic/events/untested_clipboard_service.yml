title: "ArboardClipboard service lacks unit tests"
statement: |
  The `ArboardClipboard` struct in `src/services/clipboard_arboard.rs` implements `ClipboardWriter` but has no unit tests. This leaves the clipboard functionality unverified and prone to regressions.

evidence:
  - path: "src/services/clipboard_arboard.rs"
    loc: "1-22"
    note: "Entire file lacks #[cfg(test)] mod tests or separate test file."
