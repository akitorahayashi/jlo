title: "Core Module Test Coverage Audit Results"
statement: |
  Audit of `src/domain/setup.rs`, `src/services/jules_api.rs`, and `src/services/workspace_filesystem.rs` confirms robust unit test coverage, satisfying the audit request in issue `high/qa_missing_coverage.yml`.
  Only `src/services/clipboard_arboard.rs` remains with zero coverage.
