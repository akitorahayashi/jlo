title: "Issue Registry Disconnected from File System"
statement: |
  Issues listed in index.md (e.g., high/qa_missing_coverage.yml) do not exist in the file system.
  Additionally, the claims in the ghost issue about core modules missing tests are factually incorrect.

evidence:
  - path: ".jules/workstreams/generic/issues/index.md"
    loc: "1"
    note: "Lists issues like high/qa_missing_coverage.yml."
  - path: ".jules/workstreams/generic/issues/high/"
    loc: "1"
    note: "Directory is empty."
