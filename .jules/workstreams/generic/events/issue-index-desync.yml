title: "Issue Index Desynchronization"
statement: |
  The `issues/index.md` file in the generic workstream lists 5 active issues in the `high`, `medium`, and `low` categories, but the corresponding issue files are missing from the filesystem. This indicates a state corruption where the index (Source of Truth) is out of sync with the actual artifacts.

evidence:
  - path: ".jules/workstreams/generic/issues/index.md"
    loc: "High, Medium, Low sections"
    note: "Lists issues like qa_missing_coverage.yml, arch_domain_purity.yml, etc."
  - path: ".jules/workstreams/generic/issues/medium/"
    loc: "Directory listing"
    note: "Directory is empty (contains only .gitkeep)"
