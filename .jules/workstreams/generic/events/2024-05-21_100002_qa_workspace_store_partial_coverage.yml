title: "Partial Test Coverage for FilesystemWorkspaceStore"
statement: |
  The `FilesystemWorkspaceStore` in `src/services/workspace_filesystem.rs` lacks unit tests for role discovery methods (`discover_roles`, `find_role_fuzzy`) and workstream management methods (`create_workstream`, `list_workstreams`). Existing tests focus only on structure creation and versioning.

evidence:
  - path: "src/services/workspace_filesystem.rs"
    loc: "80"
    note: "Method `discover_roles` implementation."
  - path: "src/services/workspace_filesystem.rs"
    loc: "208"
    note: "Test module lacks tests for discovery and workstream methods."
