# Content
title: "Generic Service Names 'Resolver' and 'Generator'"
statement: |
  The structs `Resolver` (in `src/services/resolver.rs`) and `Generator` (in `src/services/generator.rs`) use generic names that obscure their specific domain responsibilities. `Resolver` specifically handles component dependency resolution, while `Generator` creates installation scripts. These names lack domain specificity and risk collision.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/resolver.rs"
    loc:
      - "struct Resolver"
    note: "Generic name for dependency resolution logic."
  - path: "src/services/generator.rs"
    loc:
      - "struct Generator"
    note: "Generic name for script generation logic."
