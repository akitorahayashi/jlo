# Content
title: "Ambiguity between Scaffold and Templates in AGENTS.md"
statement: |
  `AGENTS.md` implies that `src/assets/templates/` is the source for roles, but Planners and Implementers are actually located in `src/assets/scaffold/.jules/roles/` and are not template-based in the same way.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "src/assets/templates/     # Role templates by layer"
    note: "Implies all templates are here"
  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/.jules/roles/"
    loc:
      - "planners/"
      - "implementers/"
    note: "Single-role layers are in scaffold"
