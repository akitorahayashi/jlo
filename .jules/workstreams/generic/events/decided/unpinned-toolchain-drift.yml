# Content
title: "Unpinned Toolchain Drift"
statement: |
  CI workflows use the default `stable` toolchain via `.github/actions/setup`, while the release workflow pins `1.90.0`. This creates a reproducibility risk where CI passes on a newer compiler version but release builds fail or behave differently on the older pinned version.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/actions/setup/action.yml"
    loc:
      - "default: 'stable'"
    note: "The shared setup action defaults to the floating 'stable' tag."

  - path: ".github/workflows/build.yml"
    loc:
      - "uses: ./.github/actions/setup"
    note: "CI build workflow invokes setup without overriding the rust-version."

  - path: ".github/workflows/release.yml"
    loc:
      - "toolchain: 1.90.0"
    note: "Release workflow explicitly pins a specific toolchain version."
