# Content
title: "Low Cohesion in ScaffoldManifest Service"
statement: |
  The `scaffold_manifest.rs` module exhibits low cohesion by mixing the domain definition of `ScaffoldManifest` with low-level hashing utilities (`hash_content`) and specific business rules about file paths (`is_default_role_file`). This coupling makes the module harder to test and maintain, as changes to path conventions or hashing algorithms affect the domain entity file.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/scaffold_manifest.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub fn is_default_role_file(path: &str) -> bool"
      - "pub fn hash_content(content: &str) -> String"
    note: "Business rules and utility functions mixed with domain struct."
