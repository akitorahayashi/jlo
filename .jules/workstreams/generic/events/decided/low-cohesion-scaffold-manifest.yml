# Content
title: "ScaffoldManifest mixes domain and infrastructure"
statement: |
  The ScaffoldManifest service exhibits low cohesion by mixing domain logic (manifest schema, validation) with infrastructure concerns (file I/O, hashing content, calculating paths). This violates Boundary Sovereignty.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/scaffold_manifest.rs"
    loc:
      - "whole file"
    note: "Contains ScaffoldManifest struct, hash_content function, load_manifest (I/O), and is_default_role_file (business rule) in one module."
