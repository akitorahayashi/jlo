title: "Generic Service Names"
statement: "Service structs `Resolver` and `Generator` in `src/services/` use overly generic names that claim the entire global namespace for those common verbs, obscuring their specific domain responsibilities."
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/resolver.rs"
    loc: ["src/services/resolver.rs"]
    note: "`pub struct Resolver;` handles component dependency resolution."
  - path: "src/services/generator.rs"
    loc: ["src/services/generator.rs"]
    note: "`pub struct Generator;` handles setup script generation."
impact: "High risk of name collision and ambiguity. 'Resolver' could mean DNS, Path, or Promise resolution. 'Generator' could be an Iterator or UUID generator."
suggestion: "Rename to `ComponentResolver` and `SetupScriptGenerator`."
