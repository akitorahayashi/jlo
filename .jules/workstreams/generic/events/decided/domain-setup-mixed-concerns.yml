# Content
title: "Domain and DTO Mixing in Setup Module"
statement: |
  The `src/domain/setup.rs` file violates the Boundary Sovereignty principle by mixing core domain entities (`Component`), data transfer objects (`ComponentMeta`), and configuration/process structs (`SetupConfig`) in a single module. This creates coupling between the domain model and external configuration formats (TOML deserialization).

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/setup.rs"
    loc:
      - "struct EnvSpec"
      - "struct Component"
      - "struct SetupConfig"
      - "struct ComponentMeta"
    note: "All these distinct types with different lifecycles and purposes are co-located, with mixed Serde dependencies."
