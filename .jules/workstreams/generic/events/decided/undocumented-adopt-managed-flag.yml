title: "Undocumented --adopt-managed flag in update command"
statement: |
  The `jlo update` command supports an `--adopt-managed` flag to adopt the current default role files as a managed baseline. This flag is present in the CLI definition and implementation but is not documented in the `README.md` or other user-facing documentation.
