# Content
title: "Services directory lacks cohesion"
statement: |
  The src/services directory contains a flat list of unrelated implementations
  (HTTP, Filesystem, Artifacts), making it a "utils" bucket rather than a
  domain-driven structure.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "mod artifact_generator;"
      - "mod dependency_resolver;"
      - "mod jules_client_http;"
    note: "Flat list of unrelated domains (Build, Algo, Network) in one directory."
