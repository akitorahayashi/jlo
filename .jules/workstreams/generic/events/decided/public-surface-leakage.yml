# Content
title: "Public Surface Leakage"
statement: |
  The library crate (`src/lib.rs`) indiscriminately exports internal modules such as `services` and `app`, exposing implementation details to consumers. This increases the public API surface area, making refactoring harder as consumers might depend on internal structures.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/lib.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub mod services;"
    note: "Exposes the entire services module publicly."
  - path: "src/lib.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub mod app;"
    note: "Exposes the app module publicly."
