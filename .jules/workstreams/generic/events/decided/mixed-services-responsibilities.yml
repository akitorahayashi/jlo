# Content
title: "Mixed Responsibilities in Services Directory"
statement: |
  The `src/services/` directory is used as a catch-all bucket for both Interface Adapters (implementations of ports) and Domain Services (pure business logic). This obscures the architectural boundary between the core domain and external integrations.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/jules_client_http.rs"
    loc:
      - "impl JulesClient for HttpJulesClient"
    note: "This is an Interface Adapter for the JulesClient port."
  - path: "src/services/resolver.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub struct Resolver"
    note: "This appears to be a Domain Service logic for component resolution, not an external adapter."
  - path: "src/services/embedded_role_template_store.rs"
    loc:
      - "impl RoleTemplateStore for EmbeddedRoleTemplateStore"
    note: "This is an Adapter for the RoleTemplateStore port."
