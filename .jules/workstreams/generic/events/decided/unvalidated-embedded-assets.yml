title: Unvalidated embedded assets in scaffold_assets.rs
statement: |
  The `scaffold_assets.rs` service loads embedded assets (scaffolds) but only checks for non-empty content during integrity tests.
  It lacks syntax validation for the embedded YAML/TOML files, creating a risk that broken templates are shipped in the binary.
evidence:
  - path: src/services/scaffold_assets.rs
    loc:
      - "82-109"
    note: "Integrity tests only check `!file.contents().is_empty()`."
tags:
  - risk
  - coverage
  - robustness
