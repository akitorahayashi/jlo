# Content
title: "Missing Cross-Platform CI"
statement: |
  CI only validates the Linux x86_64 target. The release workflow supports macOS and ARM, creating a risk that platform-specific issues are only detected during release.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/build.yml"
    loc:
      - "runs-on: ubuntu-latest"
    note: "Missing matrix for macOS or ARM targets in CI build jobs."
