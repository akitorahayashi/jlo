# Content
title: "Inefficient Installer Verification"
statement: |
  The installer verification workflow runs on every pull request without path filtering, executing expensive setup steps for unrelated changes.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/verify-installers.yml"
    loc:
      - "on: pull_request"
    note: "Missing `paths` filter for `src/assets/catalog/`."
