title: "Component Primitive Obsession"
statement: "The `Component` domain model uses raw `String` types for `name` and `dependencies`, missing an opportunity to enforce type safety and domain semantics."
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/setup.rs"
    loc: ["src/domain/setup.rs"]
    note: "`pub struct Component { pub name: String, pub dependencies: Vec<String>, ... }`"
impact: "Reduces refactoring safety and expressiveness. A `String` could be anything. A `ComponentId` type would make signatures self-documenting."
suggestion: "Introduce a `ComponentId` (newtype around String) or similar domain type."
