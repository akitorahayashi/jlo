title: "Scaffold vs Template Terminology Collision"
statement: "The terms 'Scaffold' and 'Template' are used interchangeably and inconsistently across `src/services/` and `src/assets/`, blurring the distinction between project structure (scaffold) and reusable content patterns (templates)."
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/embedded_role_template_store.rs"
    loc: ["src/services/embedded_role_template_store.rs"]
    note: "Struct `EmbeddedRoleTemplateStore` implements `RoleTemplateStore` but uses `scaffold_files()` method and reads from `src/assets/scaffold`."
  - path: "src/services/workstream_template_assets.rs"
    loc: ["src/services/workstream_template_assets.rs"]
    note: "Reads from `src/assets/templates`."
impact: "Cognitive load increases as developers must check implementation details to know if a 'template' refers to a file in the scaffold directory or the templates directory."
suggestion: "Strictly separate 'Scaffold' (fixed project structure) from 'Templates' (dynamic/reusable patterns). Rename `EmbeddedRoleTemplateStore` to reflect its dual nature or split it."
