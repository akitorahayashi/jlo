title: "Domain model file name mismatches content"
statement: |
  The file `src/domain/setup.rs` contains domain entities `Component` and `EnvSpec`, but is named after the process "setup", creating confusion about where to find these types.
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/setup.rs"
    loc:
      - "struct Component"
      - "struct EnvSpec"
    note: "File named 'setup' (verb) contains 'Component' (noun)."
