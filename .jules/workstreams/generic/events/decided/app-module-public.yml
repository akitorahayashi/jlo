  The src/lib.rs file exports the app module publicly (pub mod app),
  exposing internal command logic and CLI structure to the library's public API.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/lib.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub mod app;"
    note: "The app module containing command logic is exported in the public API."
