# Content
title: "Architectural Violation: Service Layer Depends on App Layer"
statement: |
  The `EmbeddedComponentCatalog` service directly imports `ComponentMeta` from `crate::app::config`. This violates the layered architecture where the Service layer should be independent of the Application layer (CLI/Config). The `ComponentMeta` DTO, which is used for deserializing TOML files, defines the contract for data entering the system and should be located in a shared Port or within the Service layer itself, rather than the App layer.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/component_catalog_embedded.rs"
    loc:
      - "use crate::app::config::ComponentMeta;"
    note: "Service module imports from app layer."
