title: "SetupConfig Naming Mismatch"
statement: "The struct `SetupConfig` in `src/domain/setup.rs` deserializes `.jules/setup/tools.yml`, creating a naming mismatch between the type and the configuration file it represents."
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/setup.rs"
    loc: ["src/domain/setup.rs", "src/app/commands/setup/generate.rs"]
    note: "Struct `SetupConfig` defined here and used to parse `tools.yml`."
impact: "Reduces discoverability; developers looking for `ToolsConfig` won't find it, and those looking at `SetupConfig` might expect it to configure the whole setup process, not just tools."
suggestion: "Rename `SetupConfig` to `ToolsConfig` or `SetupToolsConfig`."
