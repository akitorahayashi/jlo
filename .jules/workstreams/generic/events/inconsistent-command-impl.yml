title: "Inconsistent Command Implementation Pattern"
statement: |
  The `workstream` command logic (including subcommands `new` and `list`) is implemented directly in `src/lib.rs` and exposed as public functions (`workstream_new`, `workstream_list`), rather than being encapsulated in a dedicated module under `src/app/commands/` like other commands (`init`, `template`, `run`, `setup`). This inconsistency makes the codebase harder to navigate and maintain.

evidence:
  - path: "src/lib.rs"
    loc: "workstream_new, workstream_list functions"
    note: "Command logic implemented in root library file"
  - path: "src/app/commands/"
    loc: "Directory listing"
    note: "Missing workstream module"
