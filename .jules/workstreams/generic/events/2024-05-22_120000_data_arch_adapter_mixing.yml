# Content
title: "Infrastructure Adapters Mixed in Service Layer"
statement: |
  The `src/services/` directory violates the architectural boundary between Domain Services and Infrastructure Adapters. It contains implementations like `ArboardClipboard` and `FilesystemWorkspaceStore` alongside core logic like `Generator` and `Resolver`.

evidence:
  - path: "src/services/mod.rs"
    loc: "5"
    note: "Exports ArboardClipboard adapter"
  - path: "src/services/mod.rs"
    loc: "9"
    note: "Exports FilesystemWorkspaceStore adapter"
  - path: "src/services/clipboard_arboard.rs"
    loc: "6"
    note: "ArboardClipboard struct definition"
