# Content
title: "Missing Unit Tests for Setup Domain"
statement: |
  The `src/domain/setup.rs` module contains core domain logic, including `Component`, `EnvSpec`, and `from_meta` transformation logic, but lacks any unit tests. This leaves the setup configuration parsing and validation vulnerable to regressions.

evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/setup.rs"
    loc: "1"
    note: "File contains structs and implementation blocks but no `#[cfg(test)]` module."
