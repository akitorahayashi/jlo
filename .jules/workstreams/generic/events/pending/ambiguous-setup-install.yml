# Content
title: "Ambiguous 'Setup' Command vs 'Install' Artifact"
statement: |
  The `jlo setup` command and `src/domain/setup.rs` module manage the generation of an installation script (`install.sh`). The verb "setup" is generic and suggests configuration, while the output is explicitly an installer. The domain entities are `Component` (installable tools) and `SetupConfig` (tool list), creating a vocabulary mismatch.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/main.rs"
    loc:
      - "enum SetupCommands"
    note: "Command is named 'Setup' but generates install scripts."
  - path: "src/domain/setup.rs"
    loc:
      - "struct Component"
      - "struct SetupConfig"
    note: "Domain file 'setup.rs' contains 'Component' logic."
  - path: "src/assets/catalog/just/install.sh"
    loc:
      - "file"
    note: "The actual artifact is named 'install.sh'."
