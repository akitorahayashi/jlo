title: "Implicit Workflow Permissions"
statement: |
  Most workflows do not explicitly define permissions, relying on the repository's default GITHUB_TOKEN permissions. This violates the principle of least privilege.

# Evidence supporting the observation

  - path: ".github/workflows/ci-workflows.yml"
    loc:
      - "Top level"
    note: "Missing permissions block"
