# Content
title: "CLI Logic Coupled to Binary"
statement: |
  The CLI definition (structs, enums) and argument parsing logic reside in `src/main.rs`. This couples the CLI interface directly to the binary entry point, making it difficult to test the CLI logic in isolation or reuse it in other contexts (e.g., a library or another tool). It should be moved to a dedicated adapter (e.g., `src/adapters/cli` or `src/ports/cli`).

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/main.rs"
    loc:
      - "struct Cli"
    note: "CLI arguments struct defined in main.rs."
  - path: "src/main.rs"
    loc:
      - "enum Commands"
    note: "CLI subcommands enum defined in main.rs."
