title: "Setup Command vs Artifact Ambiguity"
statement: "The `jlo setup` command generates an artifact named `install.sh`, creating a semantic disconnect between the command verb (setup) and the output artifact (install)."
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/setup/generate.rs"
    loc: ["src/app/commands/setup/generate.rs"]
    note: "Command generates `.jules/setup/install.sh`."
impact: "Users may be unsure if `setup` runs the setup or just prepares it. The output filename `install.sh` suggests an installation action, while the command `setup` suggests configuration."
suggestion: "Align the command and artifact: `jlo install gen` -> `install.sh` OR `jlo setup gen` -> `setup.sh`."
