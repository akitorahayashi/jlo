title: "Domain entities coupled to TOML serialization"
statement: |
  The `RunConfig` domain entity in `src/domain/run_config.rs` directly depends on the `toml` crate for parsing, violating the separation of concerns between domain logic and infrastructure/serialization details. This prevents the domain from being used in contexts where TOML is not relevant or where a different configuration source is used.

evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/run_config.rs"
    loc:
      - "15"
    note: "RunConfig::parse_toml depends on toml crate"
