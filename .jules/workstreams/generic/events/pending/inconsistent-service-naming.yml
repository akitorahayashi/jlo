# Content
title: "Inconsistent Service Naming and Structure"
statement: |
  Services in `src/services/` exhibit inconsistent naming conventions (prefix vs suffix) and structural patterns (structs vs function modules), violating the principle of consistent naming shapes across boundaries.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/jules_client_http.rs"
    loc:
      - "struct HttpJulesClient"
      - "filename: jules_client_http.rs"
    note: "Filename uses suffix (`_http`) while struct uses prefix (`Http`), violating `Type` = `Filename` convention."

  - path: "src/services/scaffold_assets.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub fn list_issue_labels"
    note: "Implemented as a module of functions (bag of functions), whereas `dependency_resolver.rs` defines a domain struct. Inconsistent abstraction."

  - path: "src/services/embedded_role_template_store.rs"
    loc:
      - "struct EmbeddedRoleTemplateStore"
      - "fn scaffold_files"
    note: "Named `TemplateStore` but responsible for `Scaffold` assets, conflating distinct vocabulary terms (Scaffold vs Template)."
