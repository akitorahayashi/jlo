title: "Fragmented Asset and Template Vocabulary"
statement: |
  The codebase uses inconsistent vocabulary and architectural patterns for managing static assets (scaffold, templates). The term "Template" is overloaded, and access logic is fragmented across multiple services and ports without a unified abstraction.
evidence:
  - path: "src/ports/role_template_store.rs"
    loc:
      - "trait RoleTemplateStore { fn scaffold_files..."
    note: "Port named 'RoleTemplateStore' exposes 'scaffold_files', mixing distinct concepts (Role vs Workspace)."
  - path: "src/services/scaffold_assets.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub fn list_issue_labels..."
    note: "Service 'scaffold_assets' exposes validation data directly, bypassing the 'Store' abstraction."
  - path: "src/services/workstream_template_assets.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub fn workstream_template_files..."
    note: "Service 'workstream_template_assets' introduces another isolated asset access point."
  - path: "src/services/embedded_role_template_store.rs"
    loc:
      - "static SCAFFOLD_DIR: Dir = include_dir!..."
    note: "Multiple services embed the same 'assets/scaffold' directory, leading to duplication."
