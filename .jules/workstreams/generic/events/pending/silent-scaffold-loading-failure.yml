# Content
title: "Silent scaffold loading failure"
statement: |
  `EmbeddedRoleTemplateStore::collect_files` silently ignores files that are not valid UTF-8, potentially excluding binary assets from the scaffold without warning.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/embedded_role_template_store.rs"
    loc:
      - "if let Some(content) = file.contents_utf8() {"
    note: "Silently ignores binary files (returns None)"
