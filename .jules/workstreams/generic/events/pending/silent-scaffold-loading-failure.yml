# Content
title: "Silent Scaffold Loading Failure"
statement: |
  The `EmbeddedRoleTemplateStore` logic for collecting scaffold files silently ignores any file that is not valid UTF-8.
  If a binary file (e.g., an image or compiled artifact) is accidentally included in `src/assets/scaffold`, it will be excluded from the generated scaffold without any warning or error, leading to "missing file" bugs that are hard to diagnose.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/embedded_role_template_store.rs"
    loc:
      - "collect_files"
    note: "`if let Some(content) = file.contents_utf8()` silently skips files where utf8 validation fails, with no `else` block to log or error."
