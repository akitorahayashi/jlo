# Content
title: "Partial Artifact Promotion"
statement: |
  The `release.yml` workflow downloads the pre-built `jlo-linux-x86_64` artifact from `build.yml`, but rebuilds macOS and ARM targets from source during the release process.
  This violates the "build once" principle and risks releasing binaries that differ from what was tested (if they were tested at all).

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/release.yml"
    loc:
      - "run: cargo build --release --target ${{ matrix.target }}"
    note: "Rebuilds non-Linux artifacts from source."
