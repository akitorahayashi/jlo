# Content
title: "Partial Artifact Promotion"
statement: |
  The release workflow rebuilds binaries for macOS and ARM targets instead of promoting tested artifacts. Only Linux x86_64 binaries are reused from the build stage.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/release.yml"
    loc:
      - "Build (native)"
      - "Build (cross)"
    note: "These steps run for macOS and ARM targets because artifact download is skipped."
  - path: ".github/workflows/build.yml"
    loc:
      - "job: build-release"
    note: "Only builds and uploads jlo-linux-x86_64."
