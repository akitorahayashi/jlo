title: "Service layer is flattened and low-cohesion"
statement: |
  The `src/services` module flattens all implementations into a single list of exports, and `managed_defaults.rs` acts as a utility bucket rather than a cohesive service.
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub use ..."
    note: "All services re-exported at the same level."
  - path: "src/services/managed_defaults.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub fn hash_content"
      - "pub fn hash_file"
    note: "Mixes hashing utilities with manifest domain logic."
