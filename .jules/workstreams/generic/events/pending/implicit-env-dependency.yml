title: "Implicit dependency on environment variables in HTTP client"
statement: |
  The `HttpJulesClient` in `src/services/jules_client_http.rs` contains methods (`from_env`, `from_env_with_config`) that directly access the process environment via `std::env::var`. This creates an implicit dependency on global state, making the client harder to test and violating the "Boundary Sovereignty" principle. The client should accept the API key as an explicit argument, with environment loading handled at the application entry point.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/jules_client_http.rs"
    loc:
      - "std::env::var(\"JULES_API_KEY\")"
    note: "Direct access to environment variables inside the service implementation."
