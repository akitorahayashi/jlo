title: "Services directory mixes Domain Services and Infrastructure Adapters"
statement: |
  The `src/services/` directory contains both pure Domain Services (e.g., `Resolver`) and Infrastructure Adapters (e.g., `HttpJulesClient`, `FilesystemWorkspaceStore`). This obscures the architectural boundary between the core application logic and external interfaces, making it difficult to verify that business logic is isolated from I/O.

evidence:
  - path: "src/services/resolver.rs"
    loc: "1"
    note: "Domain Service (pure business logic)"
  - path: "src/services/jules_client_http.rs"
    loc: "1"
    note: "Infrastructure Adapter (HTTP implementation)"
  - path: "src/services/workspace_filesystem.rs"
    loc: "1"
    note: "Infrastructure Adapter (Filesystem implementation)"
