# Content
title: "Weak Integration Assertions"
statement: |
  Integration tests verify command exit codes and basic output strings but fail to validate the semantic correctness of side effects or complex outputs.
  This creates a "false safety" where code is "covered" by a test, but incorrect behavior (wrong plan, wrong file content) would go unnoticed.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "tests/cli_commands.rs"
    loc:
      - "update_dry_run_shows_plan"
    note: "Asserts stdout contains 'Dry Run' but does not validate the content of the plan."

  - path: "tests/cli_commands.rs"
    loc:
      - "run_implementers_dry_run_with_issue_file"
    note: "Asserts stdout contains 'Would dispatch workflow' but does not validate which workflow or parameters."
