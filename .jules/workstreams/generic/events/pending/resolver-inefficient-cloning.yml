# Content
title: "Inefficient Cloning in Dependency Resolver"
statement: |
  The `Resolver::resolve` method in `src/services/resolver.rs` performs inefficient data transformations by cloning entire `Component` structs, including potentially large `script_content`, during the dependency collection and topological sort process. The algorithm should operate on lightweight metadata or references until the final result is constructed.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/resolver.rs"
    loc:
      - "collected.insert(name.to_string(), component.clone())"
    note: "The `collect_dependencies` function clones the full component, which is unnecessary for graph traversal."
