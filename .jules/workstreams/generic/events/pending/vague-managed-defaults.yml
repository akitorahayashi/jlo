# Content
title: "Vague 'Managed Defaults' Terminology"
statement: |
  The component `ManagedDefaultsManifest` in `src/services/managed_defaults.rs` is responsible for tracking scaffold file integrity and checksums. The name "Managed Defaults" is vague and implies configuration defaults rather than file integrity tracking.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/managed_defaults.rs"
    loc:
      - "struct ManagedDefaultsManifest"
    note: "Tracks file paths and SHA256 hashes, not defaults."
