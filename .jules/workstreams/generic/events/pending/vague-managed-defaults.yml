title: "Vague \"Managed Defaults\" terminology"
statement: |
  The term "Managed Defaults" is vague and does not clearly convey the responsibility of tracking scaffold file checksums.
  The component acts as a manifest for scaffold file integrity/versioning.
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/managed_defaults.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub struct ManagedDefaultsManifest"
    note: "Tracks file paths and sha256 hashes, not just 'defaults'. Suggest renaming to ScaffoldManifest."
