# Content
title: "Overloaded 'Scaffold' and 'Template' Terminology"
statement: |
  The term "scaffold" is used for both the immutable directory structure (`src/assets/scaffold`) and the concept of "templates" (via `scaffold_assets.rs`). "Template" is used for blueprints (`src/assets/templates`, `jlo template`). The codebase mixes these terms, with `scaffold_assets.rs` reading static reference data and `workstream_template_assets.rs` reading blueprints, creating ambiguity about what constitutes the "scaffold" versus a "template".

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/scaffold_assets.rs"
    loc:
      - "static SCAFFOLD_DIR"
    note: "Reads from src/assets/scaffold, effectively treating it as static assets."
  - path: "src/services/workstream_template_assets.rs"
    loc:
      - "static TEMPLATES_DIR"
    note: "Reads from src/assets/templates, treating them as blueprints."
  - path: "Cargo.toml"
    loc:
      - "description"
    note: "Refers to 'workspace scaffolding'."
