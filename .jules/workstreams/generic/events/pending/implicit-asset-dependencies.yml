title: Implicit Asset Dependencies
statement: |
  Services like `scaffold_assets.rs` and `workstream_template_assets.rs` rely on `include_dir!` to embed files at compile time. These dependencies are implicit and unchecked by tests, meaning that missing or malformed assets could cause runtime failures or return errors that are only caught in integration tests or production.

evidence:
  - path: src/services/scaffold_assets.rs
    loc:
      - "5"
    note: "Uses `include_dir!` without corresponding tests to verify structure or content."
  - path: src/services/workstream_template_assets.rs
    loc:
      - "6"
    note: "Similar usage of `include_dir!` without validation tests."
