# Content
title: "Missing Coverage Instrumentation"
statement: |
  The project lacks any code coverage measurement tools or CI steps.
  Without coverage metrics, the team is blind to regression risks and cannot effectively identify untested code paths.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "Cargo.toml"
    loc:
      - "dev-dependencies"
    note: "No coverage tool (e.g., tarpaulin) listed in dependencies."

  - path: ".github/workflows/run-tests.yml"
    loc:
      - "jobs.test.steps"
    note: "CI workflow runs `cargo test` but does not collect or report coverage data."
