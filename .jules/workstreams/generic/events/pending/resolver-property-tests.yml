title: "Dependency resolver lacks property-based testing"
statement: |
  The topological sort algorithm in Resolver is tested only with a small set of hand-crafted examples. It lacks property-based tests to verify correctness across a wider range of generated dependency graphs, potentially missing edge cases in cycle detection or ordering.
