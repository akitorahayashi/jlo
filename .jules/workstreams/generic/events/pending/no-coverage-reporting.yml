title: Missing CI Coverage Reporting
statement: |
  The CI pipeline runs tests but does not collect or report code coverage metrics, preventing visibility into regression risks and untested code paths.

evidence:
  - path: .github/workflows/run-tests.yml
    loc:
      - "19-27"
    note: "Workflow runs cargo test but lacks coverage tools like tarpaulin or grcov."
