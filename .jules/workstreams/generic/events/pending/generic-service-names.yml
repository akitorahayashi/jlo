title: Generic Service Names
statement: The structs `Resolver` and `Generator` in `src/services/` use overly generic
  names that obscure their specific domain responsibilities (Component Dependency
  Resolution and Setup Artifact Generation).
evidence:
- path: src/services/resolver.rs
  note: pub struct Resolver;
  loc:
  - src
  - services
  - resolver.rs
- path: src/services/generator.rs
  note: pub struct Generator;
  loc:
  - src
  - services
  - generator.rs
