# Content
title: "Missing Unit Tests for Workstream Template Assets"
statement: |
  The service `src/services/workstream_template_assets.rs` lacks unit tests. It is responsible for serving templates for new workstreams. Failures here would block users from creating workstreams.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/workstream_template_assets.rs"
    loc:
      - "1-47"
    note: "Entire file lacks a test module or unit tests."
