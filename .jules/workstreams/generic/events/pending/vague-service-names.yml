# Content
title: "Generic service names `Resolver` and `Generator` lack domain specificity"
statement: |
  The structs `Resolver` and `Generator` in `src/services/` use generic names that obscure their specific domain responsibilities (dependency resolution and setup artifact generation). This violates the principle "Names Are Interfaces: optimize for comprehension".

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/resolver.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub struct Resolver;"
    note: "Defines generic Resolver struct for component dependencies"
  - path: "src/services/generator.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub struct Generator;"
    note: "Defines generic Generator struct for setup artifacts"
