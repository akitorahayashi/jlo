title: "Monolithic CI Pipeline"
statement: |
  The `ci-workflows.yml` workflow triggers `lint`, `build`, and `test` jobs on every push and PR to main without `paths` filtering.
  This causes unnecessary resource consumption and slower feedback loops for changes that do not affect the build (e.g., documentation).

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/ci-workflows.yml"
    loc:
      - "on:"
      - "  push:"
      - "    branches: [ \"main\" ]"
      - "  pull_request:"
      - "    branches: [ \"main\" ]"
    note: "Triggers on all pushes/PRs without path filters."
