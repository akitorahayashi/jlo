title: "DependencyResolver lacks property-based tests"
statement: |
  The `DependencyResolver` implements Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting and cycle detection. While unit tests exist for specific cases, there are no property-based tests (e.g., `proptest`) to verify invariants (acyclicity, all dependencies precede dependents) across a wide range of generated graph structures.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/dependency_resolver.rs"
    loc:
      - "mod tests"
    note: "Tests cover manual cases but lack generative testing for graph algorithms."
