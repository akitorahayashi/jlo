title: "Setup command vs Install artifact ambiguity"
statement: |
  The "setup" command generates an "install" script, creating a mild ambiguity between the command verb and the generated artifact name.
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/setup/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "mod.rs"
    note: "Command is 'setup'."
  - path: "src/assets/catalog/install.sh"
    loc:
      - "install.sh"
    note: "Artifact is 'install.sh'."
