title: "Undocumented --adopt-managed flag for update command"
statement: |
  The `jlo update` command supports an `--adopt-managed` flag in implementation, but this flag is absent from the `README.md` command documentation.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/update.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub adopt_managed: bool"
    note: "Flag exists in options struct"
  - path: "README.md"
    loc:
      - "jlo update [--dry-run] [--workflows]"
    note: "Flag missing from command reference"
