# Content
title: "Silent failure in asset loading for non-UTF8 files"
statement: |
  EmbeddedRoleTemplateStore (and potentially other asset loaders) silently ignores files with invalid UTF-8 sequences.
  This can lead to incomplete deployments where expected files are missing without any error or warning to the user.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/embedded_role_template_store.rs"
    loc:
      - "collect_files"
    note: "if let Some(content) = file.contents_utf8() { ... } else { /* silently skipped */ }"
