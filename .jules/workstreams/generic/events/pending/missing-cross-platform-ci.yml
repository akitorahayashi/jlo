# Content
title: "Missing Cross-Platform CI"
statement: |
  The `build.yml` workflow only runs on `ubuntu-latest`, validating only the Linux x86_64 target.
  This leaves macOS and ARM targets untested in the commit pipeline, risking build failures or bugs on those platforms that are only detected during release.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/build.yml"
    loc:
      - "runs-on: ubuntu-latest"
    note: "CI build jobs are restricted to Ubuntu environment."
