title: "Outdated Project Structure and Tech Stack in AGENTS.md"
statement: "The Project Structure and Tech Stack sections in `AGENTS.md` reference removed services (clipboard) and outdated filenames (role_template_service, jules_api) in `src/services/`."
evidence:
  - "AGENTS.md Tech Stack: `Clipboard: arboard` (but `grep -r clipboard src/` shows no results)."
  - "AGENTS.md Structure: lists `clipboard_arboard` in `src/services/` (file is missing)."
  - "AGENTS.md Structure: lists `role_template_service` (renamed to `embedded_role_template_store.rs`)."
  - "AGENTS.md Structure: lists `jules_api` (renamed to `jules_client_http.rs`)."
