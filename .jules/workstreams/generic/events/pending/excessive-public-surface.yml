title: "Excessive public surface in src/lib.rs"
statement: |
  The library entry point `src/lib.rs` indiscriminately exports internal modules (`app`, `services`, `ports`) as public. This exposes the entire internal structure of the application to consumers, violating the principle of "Public Surface Minimization". It prevents internal refactoring as any internal change becomes a breaking change for the public API.

evidence:
  - path: "src/lib.rs"
    loc: "3-6"
    note: "pub mod app; pub mod domain; pub mod ports; pub mod services;"
