title: "Blind Spots: No Coverage Collection"
statement: |
  The project lacks any mechanism to collect or report code coverage. This leaves the team blind to regression risks and unable to verify if critical paths are actually tested.
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/run-tests.yml"
    loc:
      - "jobs.test.steps"
    note: "Workflow runs `cargo test` but includes no coverage collection steps (e.g., tarpaulin, grcov)."
  - path: "Cargo.toml"
    loc:
      - "[dev-dependencies]"
    note: "No coverage tools listed in development dependencies."
