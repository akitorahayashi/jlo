# Content
title: "Inconsistent Rust Toolchain Versions"
statement: |
  The build and test workflows use the 'stable' Rust toolchain (defaulting from the setup action), while the release workflow explicitly pins '1.90.0'. This creates a risk where code passes CI on a newer compiler but fails or behaves differently in the release build.

# Evidence supporting the observation
