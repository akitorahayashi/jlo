title: "Primitive Obsession in Component Model"
statement: |
  The `Component` domain model exhibits primitive obsession by using `String` for the `name` field and `Vec<String>` for `dependencies`. Unlike `RoleId` which enforces invariants via a value object, `Component` relies on raw strings, permitting invalid states (e.g., empty strings, forbidden characters) to propagate through the domain and requiring redundant validation or "stringly typed" logic.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/setup.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub struct Component"
    note: "The `Component` struct defines `name` as `String` and `dependencies` as `Vec<String>`."

  - path: "src/domain/setup.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub name: String,"
    note: "Lack of a `ComponentId` or similar value object means no invariants are enforced at the type level."
