title: "Misplaced Component Domain Entities"
statement: |
  The file `src/domain/setup.rs` serves as a catch-all container for `Component`, `EnvSpec`, and `ComponentMeta`, which are core domain entities. This naming (`setup.rs` vs `Component` struct) creates a mismatch between the file's "verb" name (Setup process) and its "noun" content (Component entities).
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/setup.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub struct Component"
      - "pub struct EnvSpec"
      - "pub struct ComponentMeta"
    note: "Core entities defined in 'setup.rs' rather than 'component.rs' or 'catalog.rs'."
  - path: "src/ports/component_catalog.rs"
    loc:
      - "use crate::domain::setup::Component;"
    note: "Ports must import from 'setup' to access 'Component', leaking the setup process context into the catalog domain."
