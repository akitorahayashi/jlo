# Content
title: "Installer Verification is Manual Only"
statement: |
  The `verify-installers.yml` workflow is configured to run only on `workflow_dispatch`.
  This means changes to installer scripts in `src/assets/catalog/` are not automatically verified on Pull Requests, creating a risk of regression.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/verify-installers.yml"
    loc:
      - "on:"
      - "  workflow_dispatch: # Manual trigger only"
    note: "Workflow is restricted to manual execution only."
