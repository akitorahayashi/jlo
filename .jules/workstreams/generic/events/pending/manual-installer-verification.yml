title: "Manual Installer Verification Gap"
statement: "The installer verification workflow `verify-installers.yml` is configured to run only on manual dispatch (`workflow_dispatch`), leaving the installer scripts in `src/assets/catalog` untested in CI/CD."
evidence: >-
  `.github/workflows/verify-installers.yml` has only `on: workflow_dispatch` trigger.
  It installs components like `swift`, `uv`, `just` from `src/assets/catalog`.
  These scripts are not executed in `ci-workflows.yml`, meaning broken install scripts will not block PRs or be detected automatically.
