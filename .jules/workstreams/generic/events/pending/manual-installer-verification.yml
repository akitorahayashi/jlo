# Content
title: "Manual Installer Verification Gap"
statement: |
  The installer verification workflow `verify-installers.yml` is configured to run only on manual dispatch (`workflow_dispatch`), leaving the installer scripts in `src/assets/catalog` untested in CI/CD.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/verify-installers.yml"
    loc:
      - "on"
    note: "Workflow has only `workflow_dispatch` trigger."
  - path: ".github/workflows/ci-workflows.yml"
    loc:
      - "jobs"
    note: "Does not invoke verify-installers workflow."
