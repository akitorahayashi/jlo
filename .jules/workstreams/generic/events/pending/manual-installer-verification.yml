# Content
title: "Manual Installer Verification"
statement: |
  The `verify-installers.yml` workflow is configured to run only on `workflow_dispatch`. This means changes to installer scripts in `src/assets/catalog/` are not automatically verified in CI, increasing the risk of broken installers.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/verify-installers.yml"
    loc:
      - "on: workflow_dispatch"
    note: "The workflow lacks automatic triggers like `push` or `pull_request`."
