title: "Artifact Rebuilding in Release Pipeline"
statement: "The release pipeline rebuilds binaries from source instead of promoting verified artifacts from the build pipeline, creating a risk that the released artifact differs from what was tested."
evidence: >-
  In `.github/workflows/release.yml`, the `build` job runs `cargo build --release` using toolchain `1.90.0`.
  In `.github/workflows/build.yml` (used by CI), the `build-release` job runs `cargo build --release` using the default `setup` action (stable).
  There is no artifact passing between CI and Release; `release.yml` starts from source.
