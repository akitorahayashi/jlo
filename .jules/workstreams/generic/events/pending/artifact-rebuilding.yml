# Content
title: "Artifact Rebuilding in Release Pipeline"
statement: |
  The release pipeline rebuilds binaries from source instead of promoting verified artifacts from the build pipeline, creating a risk that the released artifact differs from what was tested.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/release.yml"
    loc:
      - "jobs.build"
    note: "Runs `cargo build --release` using toolchain `1.90.0`."
  - path: ".github/workflows/build.yml"
    loc:
      - "jobs.build-release"
    note: "Runs `cargo build --release` using default `setup` action (stable)."
