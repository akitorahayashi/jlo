title: "Domain entities coupled to Serde"
statement: |
  Domain entities in `setup.rs` and `run_config.rs` derive `serde::Deserialize` or define internal DTOs with serde attributes. This couples the domain model directly to the serialization mechanism, preventing the domain from evolving independently of external formats and enforcing a 1:1 mapping between domain and wire/disk formats.
