title: "Excessive Public Surface in Library Entry Point"
statement: |
  `src/lib.rs` exports the entire `app` module as public (`pub mod app;`), exposing the internal application structure, commands, and configuration to external consumers.

  The `src/main.rs` only needs a single entry point (e.g., `cli::run()`).

  Exposing `app` makes the API surface massive and difficult to refactor without breaking changes. It also encourages consumers to depend on internal details of the CLI structure.
evidence:
  - path: "src/lib.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub mod app;"
    note: "Entire app module is exported."
  - path: "src/main.rs"
    loc:
      - "jlo::app::cli::run();"
    note: "Main uses the exposed internal structure."
