title: "Installer scripts are excluded from automated CI verification"
statement: |
  The `verify-installers.yml` workflow is configured to run only on `workflow_dispatch`, meaning changes to installer scripts in `src/assets/catalog/` are not automatically verified on Pull Requests. This creates a blind spot where broken installers can be merged.
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/verify-installers.yml"
    loc:
      - "on: workflow_dispatch"
    note: "Workflow trigger is restricted to manual execution only."
