title: "Managed Defaults Naming Vagueness"
statement: "The term `ManagedDefaults` (in `ManagedDefaultsManifest`) is vague and does not clearly communicate its purpose of tracking file integrity/checksums to detect modifications."
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/managed_defaults.rs"
    loc: ["src/services/managed_defaults.rs"]
    note: "Struct `ManagedDefaultsManifest` tracks file paths and SHA256 hashes."
impact: "Confusion about the purpose of `.jlo-managed.yml`. It sounds like configuration defaults rather than an integrity lockfile."
suggestion: "Rename to `ScaffoldManifest`, `IntegrityManifest`, or `FileStateTracker`."
