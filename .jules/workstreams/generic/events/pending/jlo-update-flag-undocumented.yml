title: "Undocumented --adopt-managed flag in jlo update command"
statement: |
  The `jlo update` command supports an `--adopt-managed` flag which is implemented in the CLI but missing from the `README.md` documentation.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/main.rs"
    loc:
      - "adopt_managed: bool"
    note: "Flag is defined in the Update command struct"
  - path: "README.md"
    loc:
      - "jlo update [--dry-run] [--workflows]"
    note: "Command documentation omits the flag"
