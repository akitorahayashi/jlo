# Content
title: "CLI Structure Defined in Main"
statement: |
  The `src/main.rs` file contains the definition of CLI structs (`Cli`, `Commands`, etc.) and argument mapping logic. This coupling prevents unit testing of the CLI interface and violates the principle of keeping `main.rs` as a thin entry point.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/main.rs"
    loc:
      - "struct Cli"
      - "enum Commands"
    note: "CLI definitions are located in the binary entry point."
