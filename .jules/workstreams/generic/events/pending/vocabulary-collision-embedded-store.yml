# Content
title: "Vocabulary Collision: EmbeddedRoleTemplateStore serves Scaffold"
statement: |
  The `EmbeddedRoleTemplateStore` service is misnamed as it is primarily responsible for serving the immutable `scaffold` assets (via `SCAFFOLD_DIR` pointing to `src/assets/scaffold`), in addition to role templates. This conflates the concepts of 'Scaffold' (fixed directory structure and managed files) and 'Template' (dynamic blueprints for new artifacts), and creates ambiguity with `scaffold_assets.rs`.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/embedded_role_template_store.rs"
    loc:
      - "static SCAFFOLD_DIR"
      - "fn scaffold_files"
    note: "Service loads and serves `src/assets/scaffold` despite being named `RoleTemplateStore`."
  - path: "src/app/commands/update.rs"
    loc:
      - "EmbeddedRoleTemplateStore::new()"
    note: "Used to update managed scaffold files like `JULES.md`."
