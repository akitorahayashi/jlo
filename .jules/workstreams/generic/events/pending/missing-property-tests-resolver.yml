# Content
title: "Missing property tests for Resolver"
statement: |
  The `Resolver` service lacks property-based tests (e.g., `proptest`) for its topological sort and cycle detection algorithms, relying only on small, hand-crafted unit tests.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/resolver.rs"
    loc:
      - "mod tests"
    note: "Contains only basic unit tests, no property testing"

tags:
  - "testing"
  - "coverage"
  - "robustness"
