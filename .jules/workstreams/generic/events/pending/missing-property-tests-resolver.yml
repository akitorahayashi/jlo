# Content
title: "Missing Property-Based Tests for Resolver"
statement: |
  The `DependencyResolver` service implements critical graph algorithms (topological sort, cycle detection) but is tested only with a small set of manual example-based unit tests. There are no property-based tests to exhaustively verify invariants (e.g., "dependencies always appear before dependents", "cycles are always rejected") across randomly generated graph structures. This increases the risk of edge-case bugs in complex dependency trees.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/dependency_resolver.rs"
    loc:
      - "mod tests"
    note: "The test module contains only 4 specific scenarios."

  - path: "Cargo.toml"
    loc:
      - "[dev-dependencies]"
    note: "The `proptest` crate (or similar) is missing from dev-dependencies."
