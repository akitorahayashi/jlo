# Content
title: "Internal Modules Leaked in Public API"
statement: |
  The library root `src/lib.rs` indiscriminately exports internal architectural layers (`app`, `services`, `ports`) as public modules. This violates the Boundary Sovereignty principle by exposing internal implementation details and encouraging consumers to bypass the intended application boundaries.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/lib.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub mod app;"
      - "pub mod domain;"
      - "pub mod ports;"
      - "pub mod services;"
    note: "These modules are marked public, making all their public contents part of the library's API surface."
