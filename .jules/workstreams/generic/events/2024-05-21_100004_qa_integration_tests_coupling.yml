# Content
title: "Integration Tests Coupled to Library API"
statement: |
  The tests in `tests/commands_api.rs` invoke `jlo::init()` and `jlo::template()` directly, bypassing the CLI binary interface. While this tests the library API, it creates an inconsistency with other integration tests that presumably use the CLI binary, and may not accurately represent end-user usage via the CLI.

evidence:
  - path: "tests/commands_api.rs"
    loc: "10"
    note: "Test calls `jlo::init()` directly."
