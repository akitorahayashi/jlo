title: "Undocumented Workstream Commands"
statement: |
  The `workstream` command (and its subcommands `new` and `list`) is fully implemented in the CLI (visible in `src/main.rs` and `src/lib.rs`) but is entirely missing from `README.md`. Users rely on documentation to discover available commands, so this omission hides functionality.

evidence:
  - path: "src/main.rs"
    loc: "Commands::Workstream enum variant"
    note: "Defines the command structure and 'w' alias"
  - path: "README.md"
    loc: "Commands section"
    note: "Missing 'workstream' or 'w' command"
