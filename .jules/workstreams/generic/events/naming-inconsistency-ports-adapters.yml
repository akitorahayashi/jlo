title: Naming inconsistency between Ports and their Adapter implementations
statement: |
  Several ports defined in `src/ports/` have implementations in `src/services/` that do not follow
  a consistent naming convention relative to the port.
evidence: |
  - Port `JulesClient` (`src/ports/jules_client.rs`) -> Adapter `HttpJulesClient` (`src/services/jules_api.rs`). File name mismatch `client` vs `api`.
  - Port `ClipboardWriter` (`src/ports/clipboard_writer.rs`) -> Adapter `ArboardClipboard` (`src/services/clipboard_arboard.rs`). File name mismatch `writer` vs `arboard`.
  - Port `ComponentCatalog` (`src/ports/component_catalog.rs`) -> Adapter `EmbeddedCatalog` (`src/services/catalog.rs`). File name mismatch `component_catalog` vs `catalog`.
