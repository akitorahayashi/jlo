# Content
title: "Missing Tests for Jules API Client Retry and Error Logic"
statement: |
  The `src/services/jules_api.rs` file implements `HttpJulesClient` with critical retry logic (exponential backoff) and error classification. However, the existing tests only cover enum serialization, leaving the core client logic untested.

evidence:
  - path: "src/services/jules_api.rs"
    loc: "125"
    note: "Method `create_session` contains retry loop and backoff logic."
  - path: "src/services/jules_api.rs"
    loc: "179"
    note: "Method `tests` only contains `automation_mode_serializes_correctly`."
