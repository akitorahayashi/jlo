title: "Implicit Environment Dependency in Adapter"
statement: "The HttpJulesClient adapter implicitly depends on global environment variables, violating explicit dependency rules."
evidence: |
  `src/services/jules_api.rs`: `HttpJulesClient::from_env` and `from_env_with_config` call `std::env::var("JULES_API_KEY")`.
  This couples the adapter to the process environment and makes testing harder.
