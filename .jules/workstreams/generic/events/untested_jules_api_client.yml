title: "HttpJulesClient lacks unit tests for logic"
statement: |
  The `HttpJulesClient` implementation in `src/services/jules_api.rs` contains complex logic for exponential backoff retries, error classification (`is_retryable`), and session creation (`create_session`). This logic is currently not covered by unit tests, making it fragile and difficult to verify without hitting the real API.

    note: "create_session and retry logic is untested."
