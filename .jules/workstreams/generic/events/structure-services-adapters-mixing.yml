title: Services directory mixes Domain Services and Infrastructure Adapters
statement: |
  The `src/services/` directory contains both pure Domain Services (e.g., `resolver.rs`, `generator.rs`)
  and Infrastructure Adapters (e.g., `clipboard_arboard.rs`, `jules_api.rs`, `workspace_filesystem.rs`).
  This violates the clean architecture principle of separating the core domain from external interfaces.
evidence: |
  File list of `src/services/`:
  - `clipboard_arboard.rs` (Adapter)
  - `workspace_filesystem.rs` (Adapter)
  - `jules_api.rs` (Adapter)
  - `resolver.rs` (Domain Service)
  - `generator.rs` (Domain Service)
