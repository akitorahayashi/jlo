title: "Missing Validation for Environment Specifications"
statement: |
  The `EnvSpec` domain entity lacks validation logic, accepting arbitrary strings as environment variable names.
  This violates Normalized Independence and Isomorphic Representation, as invalid states (e.g., names with spaces) are representable in the domain.

evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/setup.rs"
    loc: "EnvSpec"
    note: "Struct fields are public with no validation method or constructor enforcing naming rules."
  - path: "src/domain/setup.rs"
    loc: "derive(Deserialize)"
    note: "Direct deserialization allows injection of invalid data without checking invariants."
