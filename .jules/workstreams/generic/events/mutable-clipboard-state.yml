title: "Mutable State in Clipboard Adapter"
statement: "The ClipboardWriter port and ArboardClipboard adapter rely on mutable state, violating Temporal Monotonicity."
evidence: |
  `src/ports/clipboard_writer.rs`: `fn write_text(&mut self, text: &str)` takes `&mut self`.
  `src/services/clipboard_arboard.rs`: `ArboardClipboard` holds stateful `arboard::Clipboard`.
  Ideally, writing to clipboard should be a stateless side-effect or handle connection internally without requiring mutable reference to the handle.
