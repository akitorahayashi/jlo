title: "Workflow Template Inconsistency"
statement: |
  The README.md documentation lists four workflow templates (`jules-workflows.yml`, `jules-automerge.yml`, `sync-jules.yml`, `jules-e2e-pipeline.yml`) as available for use. However, the `src/assets/templates/workflows/` directory contains only `jules.yml`. This creates a critical gap between documentation instructions and available assets, potentially confusing users trying to set up CI/CD.
