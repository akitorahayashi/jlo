title: "Domain Models Coupled to Serialization and Primitives"
statement: |
  Domain models in `src/domain/` (specifically `RunConfig` and `JulesApiConfig`) violate Boundary Sovereignty and Isomorphic Representation. They are tightly coupled to `serde::Deserialize` and use `String` for semantic types like URLs, missing validation opportunities.

evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/run_config.rs"
    loc: "5"
    note: "RunConfig derives Deserialize, coupling to serialization"
  - path: "src/domain/run_config.rs"
    loc: "38"
    note: "api_url is a String, exhibiting Primitive Obsession"
