title: "Workspace discovery methods lack unit tests"
statement: |
  The `discover_roles` and `find_role_fuzzy` methods in `FilesystemWorkspaceStore` (`src/services/workspace_filesystem.rs`) are not covered by the existing unit tests. These methods are critical for CLI functionality but their behavior is not verified at the unit level.

evidence:
  - path: "src/services/workspace_filesystem.rs"
    loc: "80-128"
    note: "Methods discover_roles and find_role_fuzzy are not invoked in mod tests."
