# Content
title: "Inconsistent Naming and Organization of Services and Layers"
statement: |
  The codebase exhibits inconsistent naming conventions and structural organization. Infrastructure adapters are misplaced in `src/services/`, mixing with domain services. Adapter naming varies between truncating the interface name (`EmbeddedCatalog` vs `ComponentCatalog`) and preserving it (`EmbeddedRoleTemplateStore` vs `RoleTemplateStore`). Specific implementation details leak into type names (`ArboardClipboard`). Finally, layer directory names inconsistently switch between singular and plural forms across the repository structure (`.jules/roles/observers` vs `src/assets/templates/layers/observer`).

evidence:
  - path: "src/services/catalog.rs"
    loc: "struct EmbeddedCatalog"
    note: "Adapter in services directory; truncates ComponentCatalog interface name."
  - path: "src/services/jules_api.rs"
    loc: "struct HttpJulesClient"
    note: "Adapter in services directory."
  - path: "src/services/workspace_filesystem.rs"
    loc: "struct FilesystemWorkspaceStore"
    note: "Adapter in services directory."
  - path: "src/services/role_template_service.rs"
    loc: "struct EmbeddedRoleTemplateStore"
    note: "Adapter in services directory; preserves RoleTemplateStore interface name."
  - path: "src/services/clipboard_arboard.rs"
    loc: "file name"
    note: "Leaks implementation detail (arboard) in file/struct name."
  - path: ".jules/roles/"
    loc: "observers/"
    note: "Uses plural form for layer directory."
  - path: "src/assets/templates/layers/"
    loc: "observer/"
    note: "Uses singular form for layer template directory."
