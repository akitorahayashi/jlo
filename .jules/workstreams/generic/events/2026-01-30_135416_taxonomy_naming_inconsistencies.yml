# Content
title: "Inconsistent Naming and Structure in Codebase"
statement: |
  The codebase exhibits multiple naming inconsistencies, including mismatches between layer directory naming conventions (singular vs plural), mixing of Domain Services and Infrastructure Adapters in the same directory, and filename-to-struct-name mismatches. Additionally, there are instances of Primitive Obsession in domain models.

evidence:
  - path: "src/assets/templates/layers/"
    loc: "observer/, decider/"
    note: "Layer template directories use singular naming, while role directories (.jules/roles/) and Layer enum variants use plural."
  - path: "src/services/"
    loc: "mod.rs"
    note: "Directory mixes Domain Services (Generator, Resolver) with Infrastructure Adapters (Catalog, Clipboard, API Client)."
  - path: "src/services/role_template_service.rs"
    loc: "struct EmbeddedRoleTemplateStore"
    note: "Filename implies a generic service, but struct name implies an adapter store."
  - path: "src/services/jules_api.rs"
    loc: "struct HttpJulesClient"
    note: "Filename 'jules_api' does not match struct name 'HttpJulesClient'."
  - path: "src/domain/run_config.rs"
    loc: "struct JulesApiConfig"
    note: "URL is typed as String instead of Url (Primitive Obsession)."
  - path: "src/domain/setup.rs"
    loc: "struct Component vs ComponentMeta"
    note: "Redundant field definitions between domain entity and parsing DTO."
