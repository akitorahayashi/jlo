summary: "Pin CI dependencies and improve release workflow reliability."

# Content
problem: |
  CI/CD pipelines have security and stability issues:
  1. Unpinned dependencies (`aqua`, `actionlint`, `cross`) pose supply-chain risks.
  2. `release.yml` uses fragile polling to wait for CI.

impact: |
  High risk of supply-chain attacks and flaky release processes.

desired_outcome: |
  All CI dependencies are pinned to SHAs, and release workflow uses explicit dependencies.

risks: []

  - "Pin `aqua` tool versions to SHAs."
  - "Configure `cross` to use pinned images."
  - "Refactor `release.yml` to remove polling."
