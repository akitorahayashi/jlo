title: "Fix Broken Relative Link in Scaffold AGENTS.md"
label: "docs"
priority: "low"
summary: "Correct the relative link traversal in the internal `src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md` file."
problem: |
  The `src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md` file contains a link `[root AGENTS.md](../../../../AGENTS.md)` which attempts to traverse 4 directories up. However, the file is located at `src/assets/scaffold/`, which is only 3 levels deep. This results in a broken link.
impact: |
  Confusion for developers reading the internal documentation within the repo.
desired_outcome: |
  The link should be corrected to `../../../AGENTS.md`.
affected_areas:
  - "src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md"
acceptance_criteria:
  - "Link correctly points to the root AGENTS.md"
verification_commands:
  - "grep '(../../../AGENTS.md)' src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md"
