title: "Fix README Quick Start Branch Requirement"
label: "docs"
priority: "medium"
summary: "Update Quick Start guide to include the required git branch creation step."
problem: |
  The `README.md` Quick Start guide instructs users to run `jlo init`. However, `jlo init` strictly enforces that it must be run on a `jules` or `jules-test-*` branch. Following the guide literally leads to an immediate error.
impact: |
  Poor first-time user experience. Users hit an error in the very first step of using the tool.
desired_outcome: |
  The Quick Start section in `README.md` should include the command to checkout the `jules` branch (`git checkout -b jules`) before running `jlo init`.
affected_areas:
  - "README.md"
acceptance_criteria:
  - "README.md includes `git checkout -b jules` in the Quick Start instructions"
verification_commands:
  - "grep 'git checkout -b jules' README.md"
