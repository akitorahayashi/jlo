title: "Rectify Documentation Drift and Inconsistencies"
label: "docs"
priority: "medium"
summary: "Align documentation with actual implementation regarding structure, CLI commands, and domain models."

# Content
problem: |
  There is significant drift between the documentation (`README.md`, `src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md`, `docs/`) and the actual implementation of the CLI and scaffold structure.
  Key discrepancies include:
  1. **Scaffold Structure**: Documentation claims a flat structure and omits `workstations`, while implementation uses `exchange/`.
  2. **CLI Commands**: `jlo run` documentation mentions a non-existent `--scheduled` flag. `jlo workflow` commands have incorrect arguments.
  3. **Domain Documentation**: New domain modules are undocumented.
  4. **Scope Violations**: `src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md` contains implementation details.

impact: |
  This creates confusion for users and developers, leading to incorrect usage and difficulty in understanding the system architecture. It also violates the "Single Source of Truth" principle.

desired_outcome: |
  Documentation accurately reflects the codebase. `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` are consistent with the actual CLI behavior and directory structure.
