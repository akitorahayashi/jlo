title: "Standardize Port Naming Convention"
label: "refacts"
priority: "low"
summary: "Unify port trait naming conventions to use a consistent suffix (e.g., `Port`)."
problem: |
  The `src/ports` module uses inconsistent naming: `GitPort`, `WorkspaceStore`, and `JulesClient`. This lack of consistency obscures the architectural role of these traits.
impact: |
  Inconsistent naming makes the architecture harder to learn and navigate. It suggests semantic differences where there may be none.
desired_outcome: |
  Renaming strategies should be evaluated (e.g., renaming all to `*Port` or `*Service`). A consistent convention should be chosen and applied. For this task, we should decide on one and apply it, likely `*Port` as per `GitPort` or keep descriptive names if they represent specific patterns (Store vs Client). However, the issue explicitly calls out inconsistency. Given `GitPort` exists, moving towards `*Port` or at least standardizing is the goal.
