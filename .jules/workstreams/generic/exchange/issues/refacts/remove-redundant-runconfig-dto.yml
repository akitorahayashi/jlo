title: "Remove Redundant RunConfig DTO"
label: "refacts"
priority: "medium"
summary: "Eliminate the shadow RunConfigDto structure and use Serde directly on the domain entity."
problem: |
  `RunConfig` and `RunConfigDto` are nearly identical, with the latter used only for TOML deserialization. This duplication forces manual mapping code and increases the risk of the two structures drifting apart.
impact: |
  Increased maintenance overhead and potential for bugs if fields are added to one but not the other.
desired_outcome: |
  `RunConfig` should be annotated with Serde attributes to support direct deserialization (potentially using `serde(default)`), eliminating the need for `RunConfigDto` and the conversion logic.

acceptance_criteria:
  - "RunConfigDto is removed"
  - "RunConfig derives Deserialize directly"
  - "Configuration loading tests still pass"
