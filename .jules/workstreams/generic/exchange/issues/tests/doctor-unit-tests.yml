summary: "Missing unit tests for Doctor validation logic."

# Content
problem: |
  Critical validation functions in `src/app/commands/doctor/` lack unit tests. Logic is only tested via integration tests.

impact: |
  Edge cases in validation logic (regex, naming) are hard to verify and easy to break.

desired_outcome: |
  Unit tests added for `naming.rs`, `yaml.rs`, `structure.rs`.

constraints: []
risks: []

# Specifics
affected_areas: [src/app/commands/doctor/naming.rs, src/app/commands/doctor/yaml.rs, src/app/commands/doctor/structure.rs]

acceptance_criteria: [Unit tests exist for all validation helper functions, Tests cover edge cases]

verification_commands: ['cargo test --lib app::commands::doctor']
