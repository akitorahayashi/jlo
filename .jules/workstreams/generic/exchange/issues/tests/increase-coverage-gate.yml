title: "Increase Coverage Gate to 50%"
label: "tests"
priority: "medium"
summary: "Raise the CI code coverage threshold from 40% to 50% to align with quality targets."
problem: |
  The current code coverage gate in `.github/workflows/run-tests.yml` is set to 40%. The target for regression control is 50%.
impact: |
  Low coverage allows code paths to remain untested, increasing the risk of regressions making it into production.
desired_outcome: |
  The `cargo tarpaulin` command in the CI workflow should enforce a `--fail-under 50` check.
affected_areas:
  - ".github/workflows/run-tests.yml"
acceptance_criteria:
  - "CI fails if coverage is below 50%"
  - "Current codebase passes the 50% threshold (or is brought up to it)"
