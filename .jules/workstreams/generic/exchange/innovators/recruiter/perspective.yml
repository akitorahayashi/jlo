current_view: |
  The repository is undergoing a major refactor with new domain models and extensive scaffolding. However, there is a clear gap in security auditing and application security oversight. No role currently owns the responsibility for identifying vulnerabilities, managing `cargo audit`, or reviewing unsafe code usage.
historical_learnings: |
  Previous focus was on structural and data architecture. Security has been handled implicitly by individual contributors, leading to gaps like the absence of `cargo audit` in CI.
