# Content
title: "Floating GitHub Action tags expose supply chain risks"
statement: |
  Multiple workflows use mutable action tags (e.g., `@v4`, `@v2`) instead of immutable commit hashes.
  This allows upstream changes (malicious or breaking) to immediately affect the pipeline without review.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/build.yml"
    loc:
      - "uses: actions/checkout@v4"
      - "uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4"
    note: "Uses floating v4 tags."

  - path: ".github/workflows/release.yml"
    loc:
      - "uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2"
    note: "Uses floating v2 tag for release creation."

  - path: ".github/workflows/verify-installers.yml"
    loc:
      - "image: ubuntu:24.04"
    note: "Uses mutable Docker tag 'ubuntu:24.04' which changes when the image is rebuilt."
