# Content
title: "Architectural Layer Mixing in Services"
statement: |
  The `src/services` directory mixes architectural layers by exposing `adapters` (infrastructure), `application` (app logic), and `assets` (resources) as sibling modules, violating separation of concerns and reducing cohesion.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "1-4"
    note: "Exports adapters, application, and assets as siblings."
