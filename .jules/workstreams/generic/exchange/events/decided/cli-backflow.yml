# Content
title: "CLI Dependency Backflow"
statement: |
  The internal CLI module (`src/app/cli`) depends on the crate root facade (`src/lib.rs`) rather than directly coordinating domain logic, creating an unnecessary dependency cycle and backflow.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/cli/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "crate::init()"
      - "crate::update()"
    note: "Internal module calling root facade"

  - path: "src/lib.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub mod app"
      - "pub fn init"
    note: "Root facade depends on app, creating a cycle via cli"
