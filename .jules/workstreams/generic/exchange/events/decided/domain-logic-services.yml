title: "Domain Logic Leak: Topological Sort in Application Service"
statement: |
  The `DependencyResolver` in `src/app/services/dependency_resolver.rs` contains core domain logic (Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting).
  This logic is independent of application orchestration and should be located in the domain layer (e.g., `src/domain/dependency_graph.rs`).
  This separation would improve reusability and clarity of the domain model.
