title: "Public leak of internal app module"
statement: |
  The library exposes the internal `app` module publicly, leaking implementation details (CLI commands) to the public API surface.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/lib.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub mod app;"
    note: "Exposes the entire app module, including internal command logic."
