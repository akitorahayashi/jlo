# Content
title: "Missing required flags for schedule export roles scope in README"
statement: |
  The `jlo schedule export` command documentation in README.md implies that `--scope` is the only required argument. However, the implementation enforces `--layer` and `--workstream` flags when `scope=roles`. This causes command failure for users following the documentation verbatim.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "README.md"
    loc:
      - "schedule export"
    note: "Documentation shows command usage without required flags for roles scope."
  - path: "src/app/commands/schedule/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "export_roles"
    note: "Implementation requires --layer and --workstream when scope is roles."
