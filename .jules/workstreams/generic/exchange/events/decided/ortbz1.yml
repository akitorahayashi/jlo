# Content
title: "Application Layer Coupled to Concrete Infrastructure Services"
statement: |
  The `update` command in the Application Layer directly imports `scaffold_manifest` from `src/services/assets`, violating the dependency rule that Application should only depend on Domain and Ports.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/update.rs"
    loc:
      - "use crate::services::assets::scaffold_manifest::{"
    note: "Direct import of infrastructure service from application logic."
