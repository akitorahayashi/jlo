title: "Critical Gap: Missing Unit Tests for Doctor Structural Validation"
statement: |
  The `structural_checks` function in `src/app/commands/doctor/structure.rs` contains complex logic for validating workspace integrity but lacks direct unit tests. This increases the risk of regressions in workspace validation.

evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/doctor/structure.rs"
    loc:
      - "structural_checks"
    note: "Function lines 80-264 contains critical logic but is not covered by unit tests in the module."
