# Content
title: "Critical logic in jlo update lacks test coverage"
statement: |
  The `execute` function in `src/app/commands/update.rs` contains complex logic for workspace updates, version comparisons, and file management, but has no unit tests. This is a high-risk area for regressions.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/update.rs"
    loc:
      - "86-348"
    note: "The main execute function handles file I/O, backup creation, and logic branches for adopting managed files vs preserving local changes. It is currently untested."
