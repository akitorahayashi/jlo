title: Layering violation in update command
statement: 'The update command bypasses ports to import service logic directly.

  Hexagonal architecture requires the application layer to interact with the domain
  via ports, or at least not depend on concrete service implementations that should
  be internal.

  '
evidence:
- path: src/app/commands/update.rs
  loc:
  - use crate::services::assets::scaffold_manifest::{
  note: Direct import of services::assets::scaffold_manifest violates layering.
