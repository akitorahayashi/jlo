# Content
title: "Internal scaffold documentation contains broken relative link"
statement: |
  The internal design document `src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md` contains a relative link to the root `AGENTS.md`
  that uses 4 parent directories (`../../../../`), but the file is located 3 levels deep (`src/assets/scaffold/`).
  This file is explicitly excluded from the scaffold, so the link is relevant only to Jules developers.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "See [root AGENTS.md](../../../../AGENTS.md)"
    note: "Link traversal exceeds directory depth."
