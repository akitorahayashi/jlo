title: "Run API Command Hardcoded to Current Working Directory"
statement: |
  The `jlo::run` API command implementation hardcodes `std::env::current_dir()` and lacks a `run_at` variant, preventing execution against arbitrary paths and hindering parallelized testing or server-based usage.
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/api.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub fn run("
      - "let root = std::env::current_dir()?;"
    note: "API command directly accesses process environment instead of accepting a path argument."
