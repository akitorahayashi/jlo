title: "Documentation Omits `exchange/` Directory in Issue Paths"
statement: |
  `README.md` references issue file paths as `.jules/workstreams/[workstream]/issues/...` but the actual implementation and `JULES.md` specify `.jules/workstreams/[workstream]/exchange/issues/...`.
  All issue commands (planners, implementers) require the full correct path.

evidence:
  - path: "README.md"
    loc:
      - "75"
      - "78"
    note: "Examples omit `exchange` directory: `.jules/workstreams/generic/issues/...`"

  - path: ".jules/JULES.md"
    loc:
      - "48"
    note: "Authoritative definition includes `exchange`: `.jules/workstreams/[workstream]/exchange/issues/...`"
