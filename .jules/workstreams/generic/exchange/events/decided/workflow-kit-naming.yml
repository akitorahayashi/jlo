title: "Inconsistent 'Workflow Kit' Terminology"
statement: |
  The term 'Workflow Kit' is inconsistent with established 'Scaffold' and 'Template' terminology.
  'Kit' is not used elsewhere in the codebase, whereas 'Scaffold' is used for embedded file structures and 'Template' for parameterized content.
  Using 'Kit' creates ambiguity about the nature of the assets.

  - path: "src/adapters/assets/workflow_kit_assets/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "WorkflowKitAssets"
    note: "Defines the WorkflowKitAssets struct, introducing the unique 'Kit' term."
  - path: "src/app/commands/workflow/render.rs"
    loc:
      - "load_workflow_kit"
    note: "Uses the load_workflow_kit function, propagating the term."
