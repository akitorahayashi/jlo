title: "Ambiguous 'Render' Verb Overloading"
statement: |
  The verb 'Render' is overloaded for both file generation (materialization) and template processing.
  The `workflow render` command writes files to disk (similar to `bootstrap` materialization), while `TemplateRenderer` processes string templates in memory.
  This ambiguity confuses the boundary between I/O operations and pure logic.

evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/workflow/render.rs"
    loc:
      - "execute"
    note: "The command executes file system writes, effectively materializing assets."
  - path: "src/domain/prompt/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "TemplateRenderer"
    note: "The trait defines pure template rendering logic."
