title: "Critical Gap: Missing Unit Tests for Init Scaffold Command"
statement: |
  The `init_scaffold` command implementation in `src/app/commands/init_scaffold.rs` lacks unit tests, specifically for critical safety checks like branch enforcement.

evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/init_scaffold.rs"
    loc:
      - "execute"
    note: "File lacks #[cfg(test)] module and unit tests for the execute function."
