# Content
title: "Quick Start fails due to undocumented branch requirement"
statement: |
  The Quick Start guide instructs users to run `jlo init` directly, but the command implementation strictly enforces execution on a `jules` branch. A user following the instructions on a default `main` branch will encounter an error.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "README.md"
    loc:
      - "Quick Start section"
    note: "Shows `jlo init` being run immediately after `cd your-project`."
  - path: "src/app/commands/init_scaffold.rs"
    loc:
      - "execute function"
    note: "Enforces `branch == \"jules\"` or returns error."
