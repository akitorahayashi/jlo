# Content
title: "App Module Low Cohesion"
statement: |
  The `src/app` module mixes CLI presentation concerns (Clap definitions, printing) with Application Command logic (Use Cases), violating separation of concerns.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/cli/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "struct Cli"
    note: "Presentation layer (CLI arguments and dispatch)"

  - path: "src/app/commands/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub mod commands"
    note: "Application layer (Business logic)"
