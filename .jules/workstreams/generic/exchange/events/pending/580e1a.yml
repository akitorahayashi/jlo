# Content
title: "CI Workflow Lacks Explicit Permission Restrictions"
statement: |
  The `ci-workflows.yml` workflow does not define a `permissions` block, causing it to inherit the default repository permissions (read/write). This violates the principle of least privilege, as the jobs (`lint`, `build`, `test`) typically only need `contents: read` (and `checks: write` or similar for reporting).

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/ci-workflows.yml"
    loc:
      - "lines 1-17"
    note: "No permissions block defined at the workflow level."
