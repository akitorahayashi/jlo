title: "Ambiguous Naming of Application Services Module"
statement: |
  The module `src/services/domain` contains Application Services (orchestration logic like `role_factory`, `prompt_assembly`, `artifact_generator`) rather than Domain Entities or Domain Services. This naming conflicts with the existence of `src/domain` (which holds entities) and creates confusion about where business logic should reside. "Domain Services" usually implies pure business logic, whereas these services orchestrate Ports (filesystem, templates) and Entities.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/domain/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "prompt_assembly"
      - "role_factory"
      - "artifact_generator"
    note: "Contains orchestration logic that uses Ports and Entities."

  - path: "src/domain/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "Role"
      - "PromptAssemblySpec"
    note: "Contains pure data structures/entities."
