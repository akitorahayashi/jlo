title: "Workflow Run Hardcoded Adapter Instantiation"
statement: |
  The `workflow::run` command directly instantiates concrete `GitCommandAdapter` and `GitHubCommandAdapter` implementations instead of accepting `GitPort` and `GitHubPort` abstractions, preventing isolation for testing.

evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/workflow/run.rs"
    loc:
      - "15-16"
    note: "Import of concrete adapters `GitCommandAdapter` and `GitHubCommandAdapter`."
  - path: "src/app/commands/workflow/run.rs"
    loc:
      - "96-97"
    note: "Direct instantiation via `GitCommandAdapter::new` and `GitHubCommandAdapter::new` inside `execute_layer`."
