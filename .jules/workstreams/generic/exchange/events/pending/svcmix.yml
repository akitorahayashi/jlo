title: "src/services lacks cohesion and mixes layers"
statement: |
  The `src/services` directory acts as a shared bucket, conflating Infrastructure Adapters, Embedded Assets, and Application Logic. This violates layer boundaries, reduces findability, and scatters domain/application logic outside their core directories.
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/mod.rs"
    loc: "lines 1-7"
    note: "Modules `adapters`, `assets`, and `application` are siblings, mixing layers."
  - path: "src/services/application/role_factory.rs"
    loc: "whole file"
    note: "Application Service (business logic) is located in `services`, separate from `src/app`."
  - path: "src/services/application/dependency_resolver.rs"
    loc: "whole file"
    note: "Pure Domain Service logic is located in `services` instead of `src/domain`."
  - path: "src/services/adapters/git_command.rs"
    loc: "whole file"
    note: "Infrastructure implementation is located in `services`."
