title: "Global State Dependency in Tests"
statement: |
  Public API tests rely on modifying the global current working directory (CWD) and use `serial_test`, indicating poor isolation and preventing parallel test execution.

evidence:
  - path: "tests/api_coverage.rs"
    loc:
      - "CwdGuard"
      - "serial"
    note: "Tests modify global process state (CWD), forcing serial execution and reducing reliability."
