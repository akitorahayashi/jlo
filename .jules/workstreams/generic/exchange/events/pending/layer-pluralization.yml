title: "Inconsistent layer naming pluralization"
statement: |
  Layer naming conventions regarding pluralization are inconsistent. The 'Narrator' layer is singular and single-role. However, 'Implementers' and 'Planners' are plural despite also being single-role layers. 'Observers' and 'Deciders' are plural and multi-role, which is consistent. The distinction between singular (Narrator) and plural (Implementers/Planners) for single-role layers is unclear.

      - "Layer::Implementers"
      - "Layer::Planners"
    note: "Enum variants show inconsistent pluralization for single-role layers."
