title: "Workflow Execution Gap"
statement: |
  The `workflow::run` command, which orchestrates the entire agent loop (layer execution), is not covered by any integration test. `tests/api_coverage.rs` stops at `create role` and `doctor`. This means the core value proposition (running agents) is untested in CI.

# Evidence supporting the observation
# For multi-file events, add multiple list items.

    note: "Test flow stops after role creation, skipping workflow execution."

    note: "Tests cover init and render, but not execution."

    note: "Core execution logic is not exercised by integration tests."
