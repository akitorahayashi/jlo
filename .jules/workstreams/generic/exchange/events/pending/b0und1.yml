# Content
title: "Services bypassing WorkspaceStore abstraction"
statement: |
  The `scaffold_manifest` and `workstream_schedule_filesystem` modules directly use `std::fs` for file operations instead of utilizing the `WorkspaceStore` port. This coupling prevents effective testing with mock filesystems and violates the architectural goal of abstracting storage.

# Evidence supporting the observation
