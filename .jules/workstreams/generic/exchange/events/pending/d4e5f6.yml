# Content
title: "API Facade Coupled to CLI Presentation"
statement: |
  The API Facade (`src/app/api.rs`) contains direct `println!` calls, mixing business logic invocation with CLI presentation. This prevents the API from being used as a silent library or by other interfaces (e.g., GUI, TUI) and violates the separation of concerns between the Interface Layer (`src/app/cli`) and the Application Layer (`src/app/api` acting as Facade).

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/api.rs"
    loc:
      - "init_at"
      - "init_workflows_at"
      - "template_at"
    note: "Functions print status messages (e.g., '✅ Initialized ...') directly to stdout instead of returning structured results for the CLI to display."
