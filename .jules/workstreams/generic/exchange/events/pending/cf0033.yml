title: "Configuration Logic Gap"
statement: |
  `WorkflowRunOptions` validation logic in `src/app/commands/workflow/run/mod.rs` (specifically mock tag validation) is not fully tested. While `RunConfig` has basic defaults testing, the dynamic validation during execution lacks specific test cases.

# Evidence supporting the observation
# For multi-file events, add multiple list items.
