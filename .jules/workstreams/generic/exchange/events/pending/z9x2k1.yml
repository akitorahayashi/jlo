# Content
title: "README Quick Start instruction fails on branch requirement"
statement: |
  The Quick Start guide instructs users to run `jlo init` directly after installation,
  but the command enforces execution on a `jules` or `jules-test-*` branch, causing immediate failure.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "README.md"
    loc:
      - "Quick Start"
    note: "Example shows `jlo init` without branch creation."

  - path: "src/app/commands/init_scaffold.rs"
    loc:
      - "branch != \"jules\""
    note: "Code explicitly forbids execution on other branches."
