# Content
title: "Ambiguous Application Layer split between src/app and src/services/application"
statement: |
  Application logic is split between `src/app` (commands) and `src/services/application` (services like `RoleFactory`), creating two competing "application" directories and making navigation difficult.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/application/role_factory.rs"
    loc: "1"
    note: "Located in src/services/application."
  - path: "src/app/commands/template/command.rs"
    loc: "1"
    note: "Depends on RoleFactory from src/services/application, showing the split."
