# Content
title: "Domain entity MockOutput contains I/O side effects"
statement: |
  The `MockOutput` struct in `src/domain/mock_config.rs` implements methods `write_github_output` and `print_local` that perform direct I/O (file writing and stdout printing), violating the separation of concerns between domain models and runtime environment.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/mock_config.rs"
    loc:
      - "62-80"
    note: "Methods directly access std::fs and println!"
