title: "Scaffold integration tests lack comprehensive structure verification"
statement: |
  The `tests/cli_commands.rs` tests verify the existence of key directories but do not comprehensively validate the scaffold structure against `src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md`.
  This risks drift between the documented scaffold and the actual implementation.
  Specific missing checks include:
  - Role-specific `prompt_assembly.yml` files.
  - Schema file versions and content.
  - Presence of all required files in `.jules/setup/`.

evidence:
  - path: "tests/cli_commands.rs"
    loc:
      - "32-52"
    note: "Assertions check high-level existence but not detailed content or complete structure."

  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "20-80"
    note: "Defines the detailed directory structure and file expectations."
