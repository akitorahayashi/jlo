title: "Scope Violation in Scaffold AGENTS.md"
statement: |
  The `src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md` file contains implementation details of the Setup Compiler and Component Catalog that duplicate `src/AGENTS.md`.
  This violates the 'Responsibility-Driven Scope Contracts' principle by including implementation details in a file that should only describe the scaffold artifact.
  The `src/AGENTS.md` file is the correct location for Rust implementation details.

evidence:
  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "174-210"
    note: "Contains duplicated 'Setup Compiler' implementation details."

  - path: "src/AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "135-200"
    note: "Authoritative source for 'Setup Compiler' implementation details."
