# Content
title: "src/services mixes unrelated architectural layers"
statement: |
  The `src/services` directory acts as a low-cohesion bucket, containing infrastructure adapters (`adapters`), application logic (`application`), and static assets (`assets`). This violates separation of concerns and makes the "services" concept ambiguous.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "1-3"
    note: "Imports adapters, application, and assets modules, demonstrating the mix of concerns."
