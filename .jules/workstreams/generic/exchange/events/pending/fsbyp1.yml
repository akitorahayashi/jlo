# Content
title: "Direct Filesystem Usage Bypassing Abstractions"
statement: |
  Several commands bypass the `WorkspaceStore` abstraction and interact directly with the filesystem using `std::fs`, reducing testability and coupling code to the physical environment.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/setup/generate.rs"
    loc: "multiple"
    note: "Uses std::fs for reading/writing setup files instead of using an abstraction."
  - path: "src/app/commands/workflow/matrix/routing.rs"
    loc: "multiple"
    note: "Uses std::fs for reading directory entries directly."
