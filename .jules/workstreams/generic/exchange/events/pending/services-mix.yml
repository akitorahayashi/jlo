  The `src/services` directory has become a "shared bucket" containing unrelated concerns: infrastructure adapters, domain services, and asset management. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle at the module level and makes the codebase harder to navigate.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/services/jules_client_http.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub mod jules_client_http"
    note: "Infrastructure Adapter for HTTP Client"

  - path: "src/services/workspace_filesystem.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub mod workspace_filesystem"
    note: "Infrastructure Adapter for Filesystem"

  - path: "src/services/prompt_assembly.rs"
    loc:
