# Content
title: "Coverage gate too low (30%)"
statement: |
  The CI coverage gate is set to 30%, which is insufficient to prevent regressions in critical paths.
  A low global threshold allows new code to be merged without tests as long as it doesn't drop the global average below 30%.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/run-tests.yml"
    loc:
      - "fail-under 30"
    note: "Explicit configuration of 30% failure threshold."
