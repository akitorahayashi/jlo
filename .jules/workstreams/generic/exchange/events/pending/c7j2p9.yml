# Content
title: "Coverage configuration is implicit in CI"
statement: |
  Coverage settings (exclusions, output format) are defined only in `run-tests.yml` arguments, missing a `tarpaulin.toml` for local consistency.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/run-tests.yml"
    loc:
      - "cargo tarpaulin"
    note: "Configuration arguments are hardcoded in the CI workflow."
  - path: "."
    loc:
      - "tarpaulin.toml"
    note: "The standard configuration file for tarpaulin is absent from the repository root."
