title: "Fragile String-based Path Handling in bootstrap.rs"
statement: |
  The `bootstrap.rs` command relies on converting paths to strings (`to_string_lossy`) for manipulation and comparison. This is fragile and can lead to issues with non-UTF8 paths or platform-specific separators, rather than using robust `Path` methods.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/workflow/bootstrap.rs"
    loc:
      - "269"
    note: "Conversion of path to string via `to_string_lossy`."

  - path: "src/app/commands/workflow/bootstrap.rs"
    loc:
      - "283"
    note: "Conversion of directory name to string via `to_string_lossy`."

  - path: "src/app/commands/workflow/bootstrap.rs"
    loc:
      - "229"
    note: "Manual component stringification instead of robust Path component inspection."
