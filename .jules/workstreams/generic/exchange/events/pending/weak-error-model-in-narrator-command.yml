# Content
title: "Weak error model in Narrator command"
statement: |
  The Narrator command implementation maps all underlying errors (Git execution, parsing) to a generic stringified configuration error, losing domain context and making programmatic error handling impossible.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/run/narrator.rs"
    loc:
      - "AppError::config_error(format!(...))"
    note: "Used in get_head_sha, check_for_changes, count_commits, and others."
