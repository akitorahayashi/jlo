# Content
title: "No coverage enforcement or visibility in CI"
statement: |
  The `run-tests.yml` workflow collects coverage but does not fail on drops or report metrics to PRs. This allows silent degradation of test quality.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/run-tests.yml"
    loc:
      - "25-39"
    note: "Coverage is generated and uploaded as an artifact, but no steps exist to check thresholds or post comments."
