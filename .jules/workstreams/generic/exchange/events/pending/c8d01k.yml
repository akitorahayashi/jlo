title: "Missing jlo doctor in CLI reference"
statement: |
  The `jlo doctor` command is the primary tool for workspace validation (as referenced in README.md and implemented in CLI), but it is missing from the "CLI Commands" reference table in `src/AGENTS.md`. Only `jlo workflow doctor` is listed, which is a specialized command.

evidence:
  - path: "src/AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "CLI Commands"
    note: "Table lists `jlo workflow doctor` but omits `jlo doctor`."
  - path: "src/app/cli/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "Doctor variant in Commands enum"
    note: "Command is implemented and available."
