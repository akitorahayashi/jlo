title: "Unsafe Default Implementation for Embedded Catalog"
statement: |
  `EmbeddedComponentCatalog` implements `Default` by unwrapping `new()`, which can panic if embedded assets are corrupted or invalid. While embedded assets are usually safe, this violates the expectation that `Default::default()` is infallible or at least panics predictably.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/adapters/assets/component_catalog_embedded.rs"
    loc:
      - "104-108"
    note: "`unwrap()` is used in `impl Default`, converting potential errors into runtime panics."
