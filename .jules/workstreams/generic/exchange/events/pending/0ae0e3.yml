# Content
title: "Imprecise Error Modeling in Git Command Adapter"
statement: |
  `GitCommandAdapter` converts all git failures into unstructured strings (`AppError::GitError { details: String }`), discarding exit codes and specific error types. This prevents callers from distinguishing between different failure modes (e.g., merge conflict vs. network error) and implementing appropriate recovery logic.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/adapters/git_command.rs"
    loc:
      - "24-27"
    note: "Underlying I/O error is converted to a generic string message."
  - path: "src/adapters/git_command.rs"
    loc:
      - "32-35"
    note: "Exit status is checked but discarded, leaving only stderr text as context."
