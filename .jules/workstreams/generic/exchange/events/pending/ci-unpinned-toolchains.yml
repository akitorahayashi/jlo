# Content
title: "Unpinned dependencies and build environment found in CI workflows"
statement: |
  Several CI workflows use unpinned versions (tags instead of SHAs) for tools like `aqua` and `actionlint`, and `cross` relies on mutable default container images. This creates a risk of non-reproducible builds and supply-chain attacks via tag hijacking.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "aqua.yaml"
    loc:
      - "5"
    note: "Uses tag `v1.7.10` instead of a commit SHA for `rhysd/actionlint`."

  - path: ".github/workflows/run-linters.yml"
    loc:
      - "23"
    note: "Uses tag `v4.0.3` instead of a commit SHA for `aquaproj/aqua-installer`."

  - path: ".github/workflows/build.yml"
    loc:
      - "55"
      - "63"
    note: "Installs `cross` via `cargo install` (slow) and uses it without `Cross.toml` (unpinned default images)."
