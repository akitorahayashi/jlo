title: "Stringly-typed variants in AppError"
statement: |
  The AppError enum relies heavily on string-wrapping variants (Validation, InternalError), which erases semantic meaning and makes programmatic error handling difficult.
  Errors should be typed to allow deciders to react differently to different failure modes.

evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/error.rs"
    loc:
      - "Validation(String)"
    note: "Validation error is just a string."
  - path: "src/domain/error.rs"
    loc:
      - "InternalError(String)"
    note: "Internal error is just a string."
