# Content
title: "Duplicate Toolchain Definitions Risk Drift"
statement: |
  The Rust toolchain version is defined in `rust-toolchain.toml`, `.github/actions/setup/action.yml`, and `.github/workflows/build.yml`. This duplication creates a risk of version drift, where the development environment (using `.toml`) differs from CI (using `action.yml` default) or release builds (using `build.yml` explicit version).

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "rust-toolchain.toml"
    loc:
      - "line 2"
    note: "Defines channel = '1.90.0'."

  - path: ".github/actions/setup/action.yml"
    loc:
      - "line 7"
    note: "Defines default: '1.90.0'."

  - path: ".github/workflows/build.yml"
    loc:
      - "line 49"
    note: "Explicitly passes rust-version: 1.90.0."
