# Content
title: "Broken documentation chain for Design Principles"
statement: |
  The documentation chain for "Design Principles" is broken. `src/AGENTS.md` refers to the root `AGENTS.md`, which in turn refers to a non-existent `../../../../AGENTS.md` (via a relative link that exceeds the directory depth), leaving the repository without accessible design principles.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "See [root AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for design principles."
    note: "Links to root AGENTS.md"
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "See [root AGENTS.md](../../../../AGENTS.md) for design principles."
    note: "Broken relative link (4 levels up from root)."
