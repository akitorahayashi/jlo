# Content
title: "Inefficient git output parsing"
statement: |
  Git output parsing logic allocates intermediate vectors and strings for every line of output, creating unnecessary memory churn.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/run/narrator.rs"
    loc:
      - "fn collect_commits"
      - "fn parse_numstat"
    note: "collect_commits creates String for every commit part; parse_numstat creates Vec<&str> for every line."
