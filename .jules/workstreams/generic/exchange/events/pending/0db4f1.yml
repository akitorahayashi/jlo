# Content
title: "Release Workflow Vulnerable to CI Timing Race Condition"
statement: |
  The `release.yml` workflow immediately fails if it cannot find a successful CI run for the current commit. If a tag is pushed simultaneously with or shortly after the commit, the CI pipeline may still be running or queued, causing the release workflow to fail instead of waiting.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/release.yml"
    loc:
      - "lines 22-26"
    note: "Queries for successful CI run."
  - path: ".github/workflows/release.yml"
    loc:
      - "lines 28-32"
    note: "Exits immediately if no successful run is found, without retrying or waiting."
