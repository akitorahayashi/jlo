# Content
title: "Unpinned and inefficient tool installation in CI"
statement: |
  CI workflows install critical tools (`cross`, `cargo-tarpaulin`) using `cargo install` without version pinning.
  This causes non-deterministic builds (breaking on upstream updates) and slows down feedback loops by compiling from source.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/build.yml"
    loc:
      - "run: cargo install cross --locked"
    note: "Installs latest 'cross' from crates.io on every cross-compile job, risking breakage."

  - path: ".github/workflows/run-tests.yml"
    loc:
      - "run: cargo install cargo-tarpaulin"
    note: "Installs latest 'cargo-tarpaulin' from crates.io on every Linux test run, slowing down the pipeline."
