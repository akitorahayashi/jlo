# Content
title: "Critical `structural_checks` logic untested"
statement: |
  The `structural_checks` function in `doctor/structure.rs` orchestrates validation but lacks direct unit tests, relying on lower-level helpers.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/doctor/structure.rs"
    loc:
      - "fn structural_checks"
    note: "The function logic is not invoked by the tests in the `mod tests` module."
