title: "Misleading 'Identities' Module Name"
statement: |
  The 'Identities' module contains identifiers (`ComponentId`, `RoleId`), not identities (which typically implies authentication or user principals).
  This naming convention is misleading and suggests functionality related to security or user management rather than structural identification.

evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/identities/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "ComponentId"
    note: "The module exports structural identifiers."
