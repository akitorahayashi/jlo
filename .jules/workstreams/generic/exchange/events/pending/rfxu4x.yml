title: "Undocumented prompt_assembly.yml in scaffold"
statement: |
  The `prompt_assembly.yml` file exists in all role directories and is the primary driver for prompt assembly, but it is missing from the scaffold documentation and diagrams in `src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md`. The documentation incorrectly implies that `prompt.yml` is the sole mechanism for prompt construction.

evidence:
  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "Directory Structure"
      - "Prompt Hierarchy"
    note: "Diagram omits prompt_assembly.yml; text describes prompt.yml as the flat list of contracts."
  - path: ".jules/roles/observers/prompt_assembly.yml"
    loc:
      - "file existence"
    note: "File exists and defines runtime context and includes."
