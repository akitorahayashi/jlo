title: "Documentation Mismatch: Directory Structure"
statement: |
  The directory structure described in `src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md` (and implied in `docs/CONTROL_PLANE_OWNERSHIP.md`) does not match the actual `.jules` layout, specifically regarding the `exchange/` and `workstations/` directories.
  The documentation indicates that `events` and `issues` are direct children of the workstream, whereas the implementation nests them under `exchange/`.
  Additionally, the `workstations` directory is missing from the documentation.

evidence:
  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "80-92"
      - "135-139"
    note: "Documentation shows flat structure, contradicting the `exchange/` based implementation."

  - path: "docs/CONTROL_PLANE_OWNERSHIP.md"
    loc:
      - "56-60"
    note: "Ownership table lists paths like `.jules/workstreams/<ws>/exchange/events/**`, which actually matches the implementation, but contradicts the AGENTS.md structure."
