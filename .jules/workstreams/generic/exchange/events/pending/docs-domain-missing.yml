title: "Missing Documentation: Domain Models"
statement: |
  The new domain models introduced in the recent refactor (`src/domain/configuration`, `identities`, `prompt`, `workspace`) are not documented in `src/AGENTS.md` or dedicated docs.
  The `src/AGENTS.md` file only lists `domain/` as "Pure types" without explaining the responsibilities or usage of these new modules.
  This makes it difficult to understand the new domain-driven architecture.

    note: "Exports of new domain modules."

  - path: "src/AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "14"
    note: "Brief mention of domain/ without detail."
