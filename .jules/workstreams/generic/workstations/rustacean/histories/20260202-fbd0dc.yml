plan: |
  Analyze the codebase for Rust best practices, focusing on the new Narrator layer and minijinja integration.
  Check for excessive allocation, error handling issues, and architectural leaks.

actions:
  - "Created 4 pending events regarding allocation, error handling, and visibility."

outcomes:
  summary: "Identified significant allocation issues in template rendering and Narrator git parsing, plus weak error modeling."
  emitted_events:
    - "ea183d"
    - "wm492a"
    - "ip736b"
    - "pl912c"
  notes: |
    The minijinja integration creates a new Environment for every render, which is a performance concern.
    The Narrator layer relies on string parsing of git output with frequent allocations.
    Error handling in the new command is string-heavy.
