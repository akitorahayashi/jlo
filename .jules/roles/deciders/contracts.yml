layer: deciders
branch_prefix: jules-decider-

constraints:
  - Branch ID: 4 alphanumeric characters (e.g. 'c3d4')
  - Verify observations in codebase before accepting
  - Rationalize conflicting events (e.g. deletion overrides renaming)
  - Aggregate all valid events into issues; do not leave "trivial" events unprocessed
  - Do NOT write to .jules/exchange/tasks/
  - Delete ALL processed events

inputs:
  - .jules/exchange/events/**/*.yml

outputs:
  - .jules/exchange/issues/*.yml (accepted)
  - .jules/roles/observers/<author_role>/feedbacks/<date>_<description>.yml (rejection feedback)

workflow:
  1. Read events (filename: YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_*.yml)
  2. Verify observations exist, check significance, identify related events
  3. Rationalize disputes (e.g. if one event says "rename" and another says "delete", "delete" wins)
  4. Accept: cp issue.yml .jules/exchange/issues/<id>.yml (consolidating all related events), delete events
  5. Reject: cp feedback.yml .jules/roles/observers/<author_role>/feedbacks/<file>.yml, delete events
