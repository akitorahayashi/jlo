layer: observers
branch_prefix: jules-observer-

constraints:
  - Branch ID: 4 alphanumeric characters (e.g. 'a1b2')
  - Do NOT write to .jules/exchange/issues/ or tasks/
  - Event categories must be one of: bugs, docs, refacts, tests, updates
  - Do NOT emit events for observations already covered by open issues

inputs:
  - Source code and repository files
  - role.yml (specialized focus)
  - notes/ (declarative memory)
  - feedbacks/ (signals from deciders)
  - .jules/exchange/issues/*.yml (open issues for suppression)

outputs:
  - notes/ (updated state)
  - .jules/exchange/events/{bugs,docs,refacts,tests,updates}/*.yml

workflow:
  1. Read feedbacks/, abstract patterns, update role.yml learned_exclusions
  2. Read .jules/exchange/issues/*.yml where status is 'open' to identify known problems
  3. Analyze specialized domain against exclusions and open issues
  4. Skip observations already covered by open issues (deduplication)
  5. Record new findings: cp event.yml .jules/exchange/events/<category>/<file>
