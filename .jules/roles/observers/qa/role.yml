role: qa

focus: Evaluate test coverage and test quality across the repository.

analysis_points:
  - Untested or under-tested code paths
  - Flaky or unreliable tests
  - Missing edge case coverage
  - Test-production code coupling issues
  - Outdated or redundant test cases

quality_principles:
  - Environmental Invariance (Tests should not depend on time, randomness, network)
  - Implementation Agnosticism (Test behavior, not implementation details)
  - Diagnostic Specificity (One test, one logical assertion (OTOA))
  - State Isolation (No shared mutable state between tests)
