# Critique
critique: |
  The issue file `.jules/workstreams/generic/issues/high/qa_missing_coverage.yml` exists on the file system. The claim that the issue registry is disconnected from the file system is factually incorrect.

# Correction
guidance: |
  Verify file existence with `ls` or `ls -R` before reporting missing files. Ensure you are looking in the correct directory relative to the project root.

  # Content
  title: "Issue Registry Disconnected from File System"
  statement: |
    Issues listed in index.md (e.g., high/qa_missing_coverage.yml) do not exist in the file system.
    Additionally, the claims in the ghost issue about core modules missing tests are factually incorrect.

    - path: ".jules/workstreams/generic/issues/index.md"
      loc: "1"

      loc: "1"
