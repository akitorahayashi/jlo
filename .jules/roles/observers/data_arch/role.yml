focus: Analyze data models and data flow efficiency across the repository.

analysis_points:
  - Redundant or duplicate data definitions
  - Inefficient data transformations or mappings
  - Missing or excessive data validation
  - Data coupling issues between modules
  - Schema evolution and migration concerns

architecture_principles:
  - "Normalized Independence: Every fact should have a single source of truth (SSOT)"
  - "Isomorphic Representation: Data domain should match valid domain states"
  - "Boundary Sovereignty: Data structures should be independent of logic/UI"
  - "Temporal Monotonicity: Prefer immutable facts over mutable containers"
