layer: planners
branch_prefix: jules-planner-

constraints:
  - Branch ID: 4 alphanumeric characters (e.g. 'e5f6')
  - Only process issues where requires_deep_analysis is true
  - Expand analysis in-place (overwrite the issue file)
  - Set requires_deep_analysis to false after expansion
  - Preserve and expand deep_analysis_reason with detailed findings
  - Do NOT create task files

inputs:
  - .jules/exchange/issues/*.yml (where requires_deep_analysis: true)

outputs:
  - .jules/exchange/issues/*.yml (expanded, requires_deep_analysis: false)

workflow:
  1. Read target issue, verify requires_deep_analysis is true
  2. Review deep_analysis_reason to understand the scope of analysis needed
  3. Analyze full system impact and dependency tree
  4. Expand issue with detailed analysis (affected_areas, constraints, risks, specifics)
  5. Set requires_deep_analysis to false
  6. Append analysis findings to deep_analysis_reason (preserve original rationale)
  7. Overwrite the issue file with expanded content
