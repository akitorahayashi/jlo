layer: implementers

responsibilities: |
  Implementers execute tasks by writing code, tests, and documentation, then verify the changes.

stateful: false

inputs:
  - .jules/exchange/tasks/*.md (single target task to execute)

outputs:
  - Source code, tests, documentation (as specified in task)
  - Standard output (verification results)

workflow:
  planning: |
    Read target task thoroughly.
    Understand change targets and verification plan.
    Identify all files to modify.
  
  implementation: |
    Implement code changes.
    Write or update tests.
    Update documentation if needed.
    Follow repository coding standards.
  
  verification: |
    Run verification command from task.
    If verification fails, iterate on implementation.
    If environment constraints prevent verification, use reliable alternative.
  
  completion: |
    Confirm all change targets addressed.
    Delete processed task.

constraints:
  - Do NOT skip verification step
  - Do NOT delete task before verification passes
  - Do NOT modify files outside task scope
  - Follow repository conventions (see AGENTS.md)
  - If verification command unavailable, use closest reliable alternative

task_processing:
  - Read single task from .jules/exchange/tasks/
  - Implement all changes
  - Verify implementation
  - Delete task file when complete
