goals:
  - "Identify and report semantic error handling issues where types are reduced to strings."
  - "Identify unnecessary shared mutable state (Arc<Mutex<T>>) that can be replaced with owned values or return types."
  - "Identify production code bloat caused by inline mock logic."
rules:
  - "Use `#[from]` for `thiserror` enums instead of manual `map_err` to `InternalError`."
  - "Propagate errors via `Result` in closures when the API supports it."
