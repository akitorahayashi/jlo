goals:
  - "Align CLI and internal layer names for consistent pluralization (singular for single-role, plural for multi-role)"
  - "Clarify 'Role' vs 'Layer' usage in documentation and directory structures"

rules:
  - "Multi-role layers (Observers, Innovators) use plural forms."
  - "Single-role layers (Narrator, Decider) use singular forms."
  - "CLI aliases should support both forms where ambiguous."
