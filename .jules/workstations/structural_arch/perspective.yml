goals:
  - "Decouple AppError by splitting it into domain-specific error types (e.g. DomainError, AdapterError)."
  - "Move configuration validation logic from adapters into domain models (e.g. via TryFrom or Constructor)."
  - "Resolve cyclic dependency between domain and ports by moving ports into domain or extracting error types."
