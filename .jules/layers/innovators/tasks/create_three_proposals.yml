task: create_three_proposals
mode: direct

objective:
  Create three independent, high-leverage intervention proposals aligned with persona focus.

steps:
  - Inspect repository behavior, boundaries, and runtime assumptions before drafting conclusions.
  - Reject directions equivalent to recent_proposals and avoid incremental restatements.
  - Generate exactly three proposals with clearly different directions.
  - For each proposal, copy schema with cp .jules/layers/innovators/schemas/proposal.yml .jules/exchange/proposals/<persona>-<kebab-case-slug>.yml, then fill all fields.
  - Each proposal must include importance, impact_surface, implementation_cost, consistency_risks, and verification_signals.
  - Update .jules/workstations/<persona>/perspective.yml with intervention hypotheses, tradeoff decisions, and the three new proposal titles in recent_proposals.

output:
  - .jules/exchange/proposals/<persona>-<kebab-case-slug>.yml (3 files)
  - .jules/workstations/<persona>/perspective.yml (updated)

constraints:
  - "All proposals must satisfy role.yml proposal_quality_bar and remain within persona focus boundary"
  - "The three proposals must have non-overlapping core direction"
  - "Filenames must include persona prefix and kebab-case slug to avoid collisions"
  - "recent_proposals must include all three proposal titles and keep FIFO max 15"
  - "If any proposal direction is equivalent to recent_proposals, fail explicitly instead of emitting files"
