title: "Incomplete services list in AGENTS.md"
statement: |
  The Project Structure section in AGENTS.md lists src/services as containing only catalog, resolver, and generator. However, the directory also contains clipboard_arboard.rs, role_template_service.rs, and workspace_filesystem.rs, which are significant I/O implementations.

evidence:
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc: "Project Structure"
    note: "Lists only catalog, resolver, generator."
  - path: "src/services/"
    loc: "ls"
    note: "Contains additional files: clipboard_arboard.rs, role_template_service.rs, workspace_filesystem.rs."
