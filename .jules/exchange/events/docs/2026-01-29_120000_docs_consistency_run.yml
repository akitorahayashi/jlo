title: "AGENTS.md Outdated: Missing run Command"
statement: |
  `AGENTS.md` incorrectly states that agent execution is orchestrated by GitHub Actions "not jlo", and omits the `jlo run` command from the Key Commands section, contradicting the implementation and README.md.

evidence:
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc: "Architecture Table"
    note: "States 'jlo' responsibility is scaffolding only."
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc: "Workflow-Driven Execution"
    note: "States 'Agent execution is orchestrated by GitHub Actions, not jlo'."
  - path: "README.md"
    loc: "Commands"
    note: "Lists `jlo run` command."
  - path: "src/app/commands/run/mod.rs"
    loc: "Module"
    note: "Implementation of run command."
