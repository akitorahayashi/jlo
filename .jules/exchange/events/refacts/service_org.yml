title: "Separate Domain Services from Infrastructure Adapters"
statement: |
  The `src/services/` directory mixes pure Domain Services with Infrastructure Adapters, violating architectural separation.
  `Generator` and `Resolver` are Domain Services (business logic).
  `EmbeddedCatalog`, `FilesystemWorkspaceStore`, `ArboardClipboard` are Adapters (infrastructure).

evidence:
  - path: "src/services/generator.rs"
    loc: "file"
    note: "Domain Service"
  - path: "src/services/resolver.rs"
    loc: "file"
    note: "Domain Service"
  - path: "src/services/catalog.rs"
    loc: "file"
    note: "Infrastructure Adapter"
  - path: "src/services/clipboard_arboard.rs"
    loc: "file"
    note: "Infrastructure Adapter"
