title: "Incomplete Layer Enum Definition"
statement: |
  The `Layer` enum in the domain model excludes the `Implementers` layer, which exists in the file system.
  This violates Isomorphic Representation as the domain model cannot represent a valid state of the system
  (the existence of the implementers layer).

evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/layer.rs"
    loc: "Layer enum definition"
    note: "Enum only defines Observers, Deciders, Planners"
  - path: ".jules/roles/implementers"
    loc: "Directory existence"
    note: "The directory for the layer exists in the workspace"
