title: "Redundant Component Data Definitions"
statement: |
  `Component` and `ComponentMeta` in `src/domain/setup.rs` duplicate field definitions (`summary`, `dependencies`, `env`).
  While one serves as a DTO and the other as a domain model, the high degree of overlap without a shared composition
  or abstraction suggests a violation of Normalized Independence (SSOT). This increases the risk of divergence.

evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/setup.rs"
    loc: "struct Component"
    note: "Defines summary, dependencies, env"
  - path: "src/domain/setup.rs"
    loc: "struct ComponentMeta"
    note: "Redefines summary, dependencies, env"
