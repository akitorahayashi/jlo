title: "Separate Domain Services from Infrastructure Adapters"
statement: |
  The `src/services/` directory mixes Domain Services (pure logic like `Generator`, `Resolver`) with Infrastructure Adapters (port implementations like `EmbeddedCatalog`, `FilesystemWorkspaceStore`). This violates architectural boundaries and makes the distinction between business logic and I/O plumbing unclear.

evidence:
  - path: "src/services/generator.rs"
    loc: "struct Generator"
    note: "Domain Service (Logic) mixed with adapters."
  - path: "src/services/workspace_filesystem.rs"
    loc: "struct FilesystemWorkspaceStore"
    note: "Infrastructure Adapter (Port Impl) mixed with services."
