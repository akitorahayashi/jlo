title: "Missing Implementers layer in Layer enum"
statement: |
  The `Layer` enum in `src/domain/layer.rs` is missing the `Implementers` variant, despite it being a core part of the system architecture documented in contracts and CI workflows. This violates the Isomorphic Representation principle, as the code does not accurately reflect the valid domain states.

evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/layer.rs"
    loc: "Layer enum"
    note: "Missing Implementers variant."
  - path: ".jules/roles/observers/contracts.yml"
    loc: "Implementers section"
    note: "References Implementers layer and branch convention."
