title: Type safety gap in DiscoveredRole struct
statement: The `DiscoveredRole` struct uses `String` for the `id` field instead of the domain `RoleId` type, bypassing type safety guarantees for consumers.
evidence:
  - path: src/ports/workspace_store.rs
    loc: struct DiscoveredRole
    note: Field `id` is defined as `String`.
  - path: src/domain/role_id.rs
    loc: struct RoleId
    note: Domain type available for validated role identifiers.
confidence: medium
