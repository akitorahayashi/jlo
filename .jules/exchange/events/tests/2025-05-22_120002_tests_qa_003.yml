title: "Integration tests assert multiple logical conditions"
statement: |
  Integration tests, such as `init_creates_jules_directory`, violate the "Diagnostic Specificity" (One Test, One Assertion) principle. They assert the existence of numerous directory structures and files in a single test case. If the test fails, it may not be immediately obvious which part of the structure is missing without detailed inspection of the error message.

evidence:
  - path: "tests/cli_commands.rs"
    loc: "7"
    note: "Test `init_creates_jules_directory` contains 9 separate assertions."
