title: "Missing unit tests for Setup Domain"
statement: |
  The `src/domain/setup.rs` module contains logic for `Component` creation (`from_meta`) but lacks unit tests.
  While the logic is currently simple, it should be tested to ensure correctness and prevent regressions.

evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/setup.rs"
    loc: "1"
    note: "File lacks #[cfg(test)] module."

tags:
