# Content
title: "Missing Unit Tests for Jules API Client"
statement: |
  The `HttpJulesClient` in `src/services/jules_api.rs` implements critical logic for retry strategies (exponential backoff), error classification (retryable vs terminal), and JSON serialization, but lacks unit tests.

evidence:
  - path: "src/services/jules_api.rs"
    loc: "HttpJulesClient"
    note: "Contains complex logic for retry and error handling but has no associated unit tests beyond a simple enum serialization check."
  - path: "src/services/jules_api.rs"
    loc: "create_session"
    note: "Critical path for agent operation (LLM session creation) is untested."
