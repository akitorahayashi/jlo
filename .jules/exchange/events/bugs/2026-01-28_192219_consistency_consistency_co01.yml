title: "Missing Implementers Layer Support"
statement: |
  The `Implementers` layer is documented as a core architectural component but is missing from the `Layer` domain model and scaffolding templates. This prevents the `jlo` tool from managing implementer roles despite the documentation and CI/CD workflows supporting them.
