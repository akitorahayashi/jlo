title: "Layer enum missing Implementers"
statement: |
  The Layer enum in src/domain/layer.rs only includes Observers, Deciders, and Planners. However, AGENTS.md references Implementer agents, and the .jules/roles/implementers/ directory exists. This omission prevents the CLI from managing implementer roles.

evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/layer.rs"
    loc: "pub enum Layer"
    note: "Enum has only Observers, Deciders, Planners."
  - path: ".jules/roles/implementers/"
    loc: "directory existence"
    note: "Layer directory exists in workspace."
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc: "Branch Strategy"
    note: "Mentions Implementer agent type."
