title: "Inconsistent CLI Command Structure"
statement: |
  The `src/app/commands/` directory mixes file-based modules (`init.rs`, `update.rs`) with directory-based modules (`add/`, `create/`) for top-level commands, violating structural consistency.

evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub mod add;"
      - "pub mod create;"
      - "pub mod init;"
      - "pub mod update;"
    note: "The module declaration shows a mix of file and directory imports."
  - path: "src/app/commands/add/mod.rs"
    loc: ["1"]
    note: "Add is a directory-based command module."
  - path: "src/app/commands/init.rs"
    loc: ["1"]
    note: "Init is a file-based command module."
