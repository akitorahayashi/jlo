title: "Innovator comments directory missing"
statement: |
  The `jlo doctor` command requires a `comments/` subdirectory for each innovator persona, but `.jules/exchange/innovators/recruiter/` lacks it. This causes validation failures.
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/doctor/structure.rs"
    loc:
      - "comments_dir.exists()"
    note: "Validation logic requires comments/ directory."
  - path: ".jules/exchange/innovators/recruiter/"
    loc:
      - "comments/"
    note: "Directory is missing."
