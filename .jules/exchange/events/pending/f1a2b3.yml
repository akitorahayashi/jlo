title: "Production code bloated with mock implementation details"
statement: |
  Layer strategies (`decider.rs`, `implementer.rs`) contain large, inline `execute_mock` functions (100+ lines) that mix extensive mock logic (file I/O, Git operations, JSON/YAML parsing) with production code. This violates separation of concerns and bloats critical path files.
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/layers/decider.rs"
    loc:
      - "fn execute_mock"
    note: "Contains detailed mock logic that should be in a separate module/struct."
  - path: "src/domain/layers/implementer.rs"
    loc:
      - "fn execute_mock"
    note: "Duplicated pattern of mixing mock logic into production source file."
