# Content
title: "Undocumented Architectural Layer: Integrator"
statement: |
  The `Integrator` layer exists in the codebase as a single-role layer (`src/domain/workspace/layer.rs`) and has a dedicated directory (`src/domain/layers/integrator.rs`), but it is entirely absent from the architectural documentation in `AGENTS.md`. This violates "New concept introductions without integration (no canonical term, unclear boundary, missing glossary)".

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/workspace/layer.rs"
    loc:
      - "17"
    note: "Layer definition includes Integrator."

  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "1-100"
    note: "Documentation lists all layers except Integrator."
