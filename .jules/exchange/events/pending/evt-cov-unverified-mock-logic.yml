# Content
title: "Unverified Mock Logic in Domain Layers"
statement: |
  The `execute_mock` functions in `DeciderLayer` and `ImplementerLayer` contain complex logic
  for file manipulation, requirement generation, and git operations that is not covered by unit tests.
  Existing tests only cover helper functions, leaving critical mock behavior unverified.

# Evidence
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/layers/decider.rs"
    loc:
      - "execute_mock"
    note: "Contains complex file manipulation and logic for mocking requirements and events without unit tests."
  - path: "src/domain/layers/implementer.rs"
    loc:
      - "execute_mock"
    note: "Contains logic for branch creation and PR opening without unit tests."
