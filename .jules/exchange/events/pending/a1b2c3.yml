title: "Low CI Coverage Threshold (40%)"

statement: |
  The CI workflow sets a low bar for code coverage (40%), potentially allowing significant untested code into the codebase.

evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/run-tests.yml"
    loc:
      - "fail-under 40"
    note: "Explicit configuration setting a low threshold."
