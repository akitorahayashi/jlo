title: "Missing Documentation for Multi-Role Layers"
statement: |
  The `docs/layers/` directory contains specific documentation for single-role layers (`DECIDER.md`, `IMPLEMENTER.md`, `NARRATOR.md`, `PLANNER.md`) but lacks equivalent documentation for multi-role layers (`OBSERVERS.md`, `INNOVATORS.md`). This creates an information gap regarding the architecture and extension patterns for these critical layers.
evidence:
  - path: "docs/layers/"
    loc: []
    note: "Directory listing shows only single-role layer documentation."
