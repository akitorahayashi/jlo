# Content
title: "Relocate Scaffold Design Documentation"
statement: |
  Core architectural documentation for the `.jules/` scaffold is located in `src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md`, mixing high-level design concepts with implementation details. This violates the principle of routing determinism, as readers seeking architectural understanding are directed into the source tree instead of the canonical `docs/architecture/` path.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "line 1-35"
    note: "Defines Critical Design Principles, Concepts, Directory Structure, and Artifacts which belong in `docs/architecture/`."
  - path: "docs/README.md"
    loc:
      - "line 26"
    note: "Explicitly links 'Scaffold Design' to the source tree location, bypassing standard documentation structure."
