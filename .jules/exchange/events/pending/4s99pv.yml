title: "Domain Validation Leaks into Adapters"
statement: |
  Configuration validation rules for `WorkflowGenerateConfig` are implemented in `src/adapters/control_plane_config.rs` instead of the domain entity itself. This leads to anemic domain models and scattered business logic.
evidence:
  - path: "src/adapters/control_plane_config.rs"
    loc:
      - "fn load_workflow_generate_config"
    note: "Validation logic (checking required fields) inside adapter code."
