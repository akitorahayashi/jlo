# Content
title: "Domain Execution Logic Coupled to Integration"
statement: |
  Core execution logic in `execute_real` (e.g., `DeciderLayer`, `ImplementerLayer`) relies heavily
  on `WorkspaceStore` and `GitPort` but lacks unit tests using mocks. Reliance on "happy path" integration
  tests leaves edge cases (e.g., git failures, API errors) unexplored and the domain logic untested in isolation.

# Evidence
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/layers/decider.rs"
    loc:
      - "execute_real"
    note: "Relies on GitPort interaction without unit tests for failure modes."
  - path: "src/domain/layers/implementer.rs"
    loc:
      - "execute_real"
    note: "Relies on JulesClient interaction without isolation tests."
