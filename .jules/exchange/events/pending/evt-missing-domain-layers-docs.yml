title: "Missing developer documentation for `src/domain/layers/`"
statement: |
  The `src/domain/layers/` directory contains core business logic for all roles, but lacks an `AGENTS.md` or `README.md` to explain implementation strategies and contracts. This hinders understanding of the internal logic for developers.

evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/layers/"
    loc:
      - "dir"
    note: "Directory exists but lacks documentation."
