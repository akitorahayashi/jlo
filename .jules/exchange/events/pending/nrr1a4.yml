title: "Rigid summary count constraint in narrator contract risks hallucination"
statement: |
  The narrator layer contract enforces "Exactly 5 summary entries". This rigid
  constraint creates a plausible failure mode where the agent must hallucinate
  or pad entries when fewer than 5 legitimate changes exist, violating the
  principle of constraint discipline.

evidence:
  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/jules/roles/narrator/contracts.yml"
    loc:
      - "Exactly 5 summary entries"
    note: "This hard constraint forces a fixed output quantity regardless of input volume."
