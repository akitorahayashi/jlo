# Content
title: "Ambiguous Directory Mapping in AGENTS.md"
statement: |
  The root `AGENTS.md` incorrectly states that `src/assets/scaffold/jules/layers` maps to `.jules/roles`, while the actual source directory is `src/assets/scaffold/jules/roles`. This creates ambiguity in ownership and structural understanding.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "Line 26"
    note: "Incorrectly states mapping from `layers` directory."
  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/jules/roles"
    loc:
      - "Directory"
    note: "Actual source directory is named `roles`."
