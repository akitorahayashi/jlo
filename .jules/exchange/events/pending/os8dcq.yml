title: "Incorrect `jlo run` Argument Documentation"
statement: |
  The `README.md` documents `jlo run planner` and `jlo run implementer` with a positional path argument, but the implementation requires a named flag (`--requirement` or `-r`).
evidence:
  - path: "README.md"
    loc:
      - "jlo run planner .jules/exchange/requirements/auth-inconsistency.yml"
    note: "Documents usage with a positional path argument."
  - path: "src/app/cli/run.rs"
    loc:
      - "struct Planner"
      - "#[arg(long, short = 'r')] requirement: PathBuf"
    note: "Defines `requirement` as a named argument (`--requirement` or `-r`)."
