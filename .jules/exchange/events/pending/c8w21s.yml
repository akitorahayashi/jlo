# Content
title: "Incorrect Bootstrap Command Reference in Innovators Doc"
statement: |
  `docs/operations/layers/INNOVATORS.md` references `jlo bootstrap` as a command, but `jlo bootstrap` is not a valid top-level command. The correct command is likely `jlo workflow bootstrap workstations` (or similar).

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "docs/operations/layers/INNOVATORS.md"
    loc:
      - "Bootstrap: `jlo bootstrap`"
    note: "Incorrect command reference."

  - path: "src/app/cli/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "enum Commands"
    note: "Bootstrap command is not defined as a top-level command."
