title: "Ambiguous `setup` vs `init` Vocabulary"
statement: |
  The commands `setup` and `init` are semantic synonyms, causing potential user confusion about which command performs the primary initialization of the workspace.
evidence: |
  - `jlo init` initializes the `.jlo/` control plane.
  - `jlo setup` generates compiler commands (`setup gen`).
  - Common convention often uses `setup` for first-run configuration, which conflicts with `init`'s role here.
