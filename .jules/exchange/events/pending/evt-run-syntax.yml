title: "Run Command Syntax Drift"
statement: |
  The `jlo run` command for planner and implementer requires the `-r/--requirement` flag, but documentation shows it as a positional argument.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "README.md"
    loc:
      - "142-143"
    note: "Shows `jlo run planner <file>` and `jlo run implementer <file>` without flags."

    loc:
      - "53-54"
      - "63-64"
    note: "Defines `requirement` as a named argument `#[arg(short = 'r', long)]`."
