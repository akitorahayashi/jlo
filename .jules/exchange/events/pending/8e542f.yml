title: "Implicit git init configuration creates environment dependency"
statement: |
  The `TestContext` harness initializes git repositories without specifying the initial branch name. This relies on the global or system-level git configuration (`init.defaultBranch`), which can vary between developer machines and CI environments, potentially leading to flaky tests if branch names (e.g., `master` vs `main`) are assumed.

    note: "git init command is executed without --initial-branch argument."
