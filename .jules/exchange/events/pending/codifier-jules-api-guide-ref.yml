title: "Skill 'jules-api-guide' Violates Procedure Blueprint Principle"
statement: |
  The 'jules-api-guide' skill is structured as static reference documentation ('Guide', 'Basics', 'Concepts') rather than a reusable procedure blueprint. It lacks a clear step-by-step execution flow for a specific task class, violating the first principle that 'A skill is a reusable procedure blueprint'.

evidence:
  - path: ".agents/skills/jules-api-guide/SKILL.md"
    loc:
      - "Entire File"
    note: "Content is informational (API endpoints, concepts) rather than procedural."
