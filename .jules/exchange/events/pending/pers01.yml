title: "'Persona' vs 'Role' Terminology Inconsistency"
statement: |
  The term "Persona" is introduced as a synonym for "Role" specifically for the Innovators layer in `perspective_role_key`, creating unnecessary vocabulary divergence. Observers use "observer" as the key, while Innovators use "persona", despite both being roles in the domain model.

    note: "Returns 'persona' for Innovators layer, introducing a synonym for Role."
  - path: "src/domain/roles/mod.rs"
    loc: ["whole file"]
    note: "Domain model uses `RoleId`, no `Persona` type defined."
