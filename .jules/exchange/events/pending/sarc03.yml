title: "Misplaced Architectural & Operational Documentation"
statement: |
  Core documentation describing system architecture (`Scaffold Design`) and operations (`Template System`) is buried within `src/assets/` directories. This violates the findability principle and hides critical information from developers. These documents should reside in `docs/architecture/` and `docs/operations/` respectively.

# Evidence supporting the observation
# For multi-file events, add multiple list items.
evidence:
  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md"
    loc:

    note: "Contains 'Scaffold Design', 'Critical Design Principles', and 'Directory Structure'. Belongs in `docs/architecture/`."
  - path: "src/assets/templates/AGENTS.md"

    note: "Contains 'Template System' documentation. Belongs in `docs/operations/`."
