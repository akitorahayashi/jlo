title: "Missing Bootstrap Guidance for Skill Creation"
statement: |
  The repository lacks explicit documentation or schema definitions for creating new skills in `.agents/skills/`. There is no guidance on required files (`SKILL.md`, `agents/openai.yaml`) or field intents, making it impossible for a new author to bootstrap a skill without guessing based on existing examples.

evidence:
  - path: ".agents/skills/"
    loc:
      - "."
    note: "Directory exists but contains no README or schema definition for new skills."
