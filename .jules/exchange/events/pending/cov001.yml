title: "Critical gap in proposal validation tests"
statement: |
  The `publish_proposals` command implements validation for required fields in Innovator proposals, but lacks test cases for missing fields. This creates a risk that incomplete proposals could be published as GitHub issues if the validation logic is modified without regression testing.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/workflow/exchange/publish_proposals.rs"
    loc:
      - "80-100"
    note: "Validation logic for required fields exists but corresponding tests for missing fields are absent."
