title: "Critical logic in observers.rs lacks unit tests"
statement: |
  The module src/app/commands/run/layer/observers.rs contains critical logic for executing observer roles but has no unit tests. It relies on execute_mock which is complex and duplicated.
evidence:
  - path: src/app/commands/run/layer/observers.rs
    loc:
      - "1-237"
    note: "Entire module lacks unit tests and relies on mock execution logic."
