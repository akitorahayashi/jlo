title: "Observers Layer Execution Logic Untested"
statement: "src/app/commands/run/layer/observers.rs contains complex logic for both real and mock execution modes but lacks unit tests and appears to have minimal integration test coverage. This creates a high risk of regression when modifying the observer runner or adding new observer roles."
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/run/layer/observers.rs"
    loc:
      - "1-220"
    note: "File lacks `#[cfg(test)]` module or test functions."
  - path: "tests/cli/run/"
    loc:
      - "1-1"
    note: "No specific tests targeting observer execution behavior."
