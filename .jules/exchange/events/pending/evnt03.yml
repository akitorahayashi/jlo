title: "Misplaced Utility Module in Commands"
statement: |
  `src/app/commands/role_schedule.rs` is a utility module used by `add` and `create` commands, but it is located in `src/app/commands/` as if it were a command itself. It is not exposed as a CLI command.

evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/role_schedule.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub fn ensure_role_scheduled"
    note: "Utility function, not a command handler."
  - path: "src/app/cli/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "enum Commands {"
    note: "Does not expose `role_schedule` command."
  - path: "src/app/commands/create/role.rs"
    loc:
      - "use crate::app::commands::role_schedule::ensure_role_scheduled;"
    note: "Imports it as a utility."
