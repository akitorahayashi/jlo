title: "Missing Bootstrap Schema for Skills"
statement: |
  The repository lacks a documented procedure or template for bootstrapping new skill directories (.agents/skills/), forcing authors to copy-paste existing skills without understanding the required structure.
evidence:
  - path: ".agents/skills"
    loc:
      - "directory listing"
    note: "Contains existing skills but no template or create-skill procedure."
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "whole file"
    note: "No mention of skill directory structure or creation process."
