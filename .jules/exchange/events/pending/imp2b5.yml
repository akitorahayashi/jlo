title: "Behavioral instruction misplaced in implementer structural contract"
statement: |
  The implementer layer contract contains a behavioral directive ("Complete
  tasks... without interruption") that describes agent conduct rather than
  structural execution policy. This violates the scope-local rule placement
  principle, as it belongs in a global behavioral guide or prompt system instruction.

evidence:
  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/jules/roles/implementer/contracts.yml"
    loc:
      - "Complete tasks that has been ordered to be performed without interruption or discretionary refusal."
    note: "This constraint governs agent psychology/behavior, not the structural output of the layer."
