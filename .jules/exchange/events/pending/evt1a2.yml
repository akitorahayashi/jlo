title: "Inconsistent Layer Aliases for 'i' and 'x'"
statement: |
  The CLI and documentation define 'i' as an alias for Implementer and 'x' as an alias for Innovators.
  However, the internal domain logic (`Layer::from_dir_name`) maps 'i' to Innovators and does not recognize 'x'.
  This causes commands like `jlo create` and `jlo add` to behave incorrectly (treating 'i' as Innovators instead of Implementer)
  or fail when using 'x' (expecting Innovators).
