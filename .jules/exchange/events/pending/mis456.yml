title: "Missing Execution Loop Integration Tests"
statement: |
  Integration tests for the `run` command (`tests/cli/run/`) are limited to prompt previews and error contracts. The actual execution loop (LLM interaction, artifact creation, git operations) is not tested in the integration suite, leaving a critical gap in verifying the "Behavior Over Internals" principle.

  - path: "tests/cli/run/"
    loc: ["1"]
    note: "Contains only *contract.rs tests focused on previews/errors."
  - path: "tests/cli/run/narrator_skips_when_no_codebase_changes_contract.rs"
    loc: ["18"]
    note: "Uses --prompt-preview, avoiding execution."
