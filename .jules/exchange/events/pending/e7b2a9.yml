# Content
title: "Ambiguous Documentation Index (Root vs. Docs)"
statement: |
  The repository currently has two conflicting documentation indexes:
  1. The root `AGENTS.md` which includes a "Documentation Index" section.
  2. `docs/README.md` which is titled "Documentation" and structures the content.

  This violates the "Routing determinism" principle. Users and agents encounter duplicate and potentially divergent paths to the same information.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "49"
    note: "Contains 'Documentation Index' section which duplicates the role of docs/README.md"
  - path: "docs/README.md"
    loc:
      - "1"
    note: "The canonical 'Documentation' index, which should be the sole authority"
