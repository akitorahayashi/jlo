title: "Implicit Branching in Skill Procedures"
statement: |
  Existing skills contain a "Review Mode" section that implies a branching workflow (Create vs. Review) but do not explicitly define the decision point or condition in the procedure steps, leading to ambiguous execution flow.

    loc:
      - "Review Mode section"
    note: "Review logic is appended at the end, not integrated into the main flow as a branch."

    loc:
      - "Review Mode section"
    note: "Same implicit branching structure here."
