title: "jlo workflow Subcommand Drift"
statement: |
  The `jlo workflow` subcommands documented in the README (`gh`, `exchange`) do not exist in the implementation, which uses a flattened structure (`process`, `inspect-exchange`, `publish-proposals`, etc.).

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "README.md"
    loc:
      - "gh: GitHub entity operations (PR, issue)"
      - "exchange: Exchange area observation and cleanup operations"
    note: "Documentation lists `gh` and `exchange` as subcommands."
  - path: "src/app/cli/workflow/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "Process {"
      - "InspectExchange,"
      - "PublishProposals,"
    note: "The implementation defines subcommands like `Process`, `InspectExchange`, `PublishProposals` directly under `WorkflowCommands`, replacing the intermediate `gh` and `exchange` subcommands."
