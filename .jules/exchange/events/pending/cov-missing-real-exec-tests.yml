# Content
title: "Missing unit tests for real execution logic in Implementer and Decider layers"
statement: |
  The `execute_real` methods in `ImplementerLayer` and `DeciderLayer` contain the core production logic but lack direct unit tests. Existing unit tests in these files only cover `execute_mock` or helper functions. This leaves the critical path for real execution reliant solely on integration tests or mock validations.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/layers/implementer.rs"
    loc:
      - "execute_real"
    note: "Function is pub(crate) but not called in the #[cfg(test)] module."

  - path: "src/domain/layers/decider.rs"
    loc:
      - "execute_real"
    note: "Function is pub(crate) but not called in the #[cfg(test)] module."
