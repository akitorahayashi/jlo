title: "Issue vs Requirement Terminology Inconsistency"
statement: |
  There is an inconsistency between the term "Issue" and "Requirement" in the domain model.
  `Layer::description` and `is_issue_driven` refer to "issues", suggesting a GitHub Issue-like concept.
  However, the domain type is `RequirementHeader`, the directory is `exchange/requirements/` (in `AGENTS.md`), and there is no `Issue` type in `src/domain/`.
  This creates confusion about whether the artifact is a "Requirement" (domain term) or an "Issue" (platform term/legacy).
  The Decider layer is described as emitting issues, but the output directory suggests requirements.

evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/workspace/layer.rs"
    loc:
      - "fn is_issue_driven"
    note: "Uses 'issue' in function name."
  - path: "src/domain/workspace/layer.rs"
    loc:
      - "description()"
    note: "Uses 'issues' in text descriptions for Decider and Planner."
  - path: "src/domain/requirement.rs"
    loc:
      - "struct RequirementHeader"
    note: "Defines the domain type as 'Requirement'."
