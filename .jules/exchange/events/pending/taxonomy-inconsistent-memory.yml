# Content
title: "Inconsistent Memory Location: Workstations vs Exchange"
statement: |
  Role memory (perspective) is stored in inconsistent locations depending on the layer. Observers use `.jules/workstations/{role}/perspective.yml`, while Innovators use `.jules/exchange/innovators/{persona}/perspective.yml`. This violates "Naming shape consistency across boundaries". "Workstation" implies internal state, while "Exchange" implies public handoff. Placing private memory in the exchange directory blurs this boundary.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/workspace/paths/jules.rs"
    loc:
      - "124-126"
    note: "Innovator perspective is in exchange/innovators."

  - path: "src/domain/workspace/paths/jules.rs"
    loc:
      - "146-148"
    note: "Observers (implied) use workstations directory."

  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "108-109"
    note: "Documentation confirms the split location."
