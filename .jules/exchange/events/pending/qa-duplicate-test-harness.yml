# Content
title: "Duplicate Test Harness (TestContext)"
statement: |
  The `TestContext` struct and its implementation are duplicated in `tests/common/mod.rs` and `tests/harness/test_context.rs`. This violates DRY and creates confusion about which harness to use.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "tests/common/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "struct TestContext"
    note: "Defines TestContext."

  - path: "tests/harness/test_context.rs"
    loc:
      - "struct TestContext"
    note: "Defines TestContext identically."
