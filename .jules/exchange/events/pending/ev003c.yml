title: "Observer Perspective Model Missing/Incomplete"
statement: |
  The domain model `Perspective` in `src/domain/workstations/perspectives/model.rs` only defines fields for Innovators (`recent_proposals`).
  Observers use perspective files with fields like `goals`, `log`, etc., which are not modeled in the domain, creating a gap between implementation and model.

# Evidence supporting the observation

  - path: "src/domain/workstations/perspectives/model.rs"

      - "8"
    note: "Perspective struct only contains `recent_proposals` field."
