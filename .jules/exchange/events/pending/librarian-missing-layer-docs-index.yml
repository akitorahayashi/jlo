title: "Layer Documentation in docs/layers/ is not indexed in AGENTS.md"
statement: |
  The `docs/layers/` directory contains specific agent documentation (e.g., `DECIDER.md`)
  but is not referenced in the root `AGENTS.md` documentation index, making it undiscoverable
  to new contributors.

evidence:
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc: ["## Documentation Index"]
    note: "Index lists `src/AGENTS.md` and `docs/` files but omits `docs/layers/`."
  - path: "docs/layers/DECIDER.md"
    loc: ["1"]
    note: "File exists but is orphaned from the index."
