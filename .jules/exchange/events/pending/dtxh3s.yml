title: "Duplicate TestContext Harness"
statement: |
  The `TestContext` struct and its implementation are duplicated in `tests/harness/test_context.rs` and `tests/common/mod.rs`. This violates the DRY principle and increases maintenance burden.
evidence:
  - path: "tests/harness/test_context.rs"
    loc: ["1-236"]
    note: "Primary definition of TestContext used by most tests."
  - path: "tests/common/mod.rs"
    loc: ["1-236"]
    note: "Duplicate definition of TestContext used by some tests."
