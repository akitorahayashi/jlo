title: "Unused fields in MockExecutionService struct"
statement: |
  The MockExecutionService struct in src/domain/layers/mock_utils.rs contains fields (jules_path, config, workspace) that are marked #[allow(dead_code)] and are not used in any methods, indicating incomplete implementation or unnecessary coupling.
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/layers/mock_utils.rs"
    loc: ["jules_path", "config", "workspace"]
    note: "Fields marked as dead code and unused"
