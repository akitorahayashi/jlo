title: "Architectural standard misplaced in implementer structural contract"
statement: |
  The implementer layer contract includes a code quality standard ("Never define
  class or file names with ambiguous responsibilities...") that conflates
  architectural standards with agent execution policy. This should be extracted
  to a shared architectural guide or standard to maintain separation of concerns.

evidence:
  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/jules/roles/implementer/contracts.yml"
    loc:
      - "Never define class or file names with ambiguous responsibilities, such as base, core, utils, or helpers."
    note: "This rule governs code architecture quality, not the execution mechanism of the agent."
