title: "Dead Code: tests/common/ Duplicate of Test Harness"
statement: |
  The `tests/common/` directory contains dead code that duplicates the functionality found in `tests/harness/test_context.rs`. This creates confusion and maintenance burden.

evidence:
  - path: "tests/common/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "1-20"
    note: "Defines TestContext which is identical to tests/harness/test_context.rs"
  - path: "tests/harness/test_context.rs"
    loc:
      - "1-20"
    note: "The active test harness used by integration tests"
