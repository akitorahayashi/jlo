title: "Slow feedback loop due to heavy integration test setup"
statement: |
  The `TestContext::new()` harness used in `tests/cli_commands.rs` creates a fresh temporary directory and initializes a git repository for every single test case.
  This setup is resource-intensive and slows down the feedback loop. Many tests verify logic (e.g., command parsing, configuration generation) that could be tested via unit tests without full environment emulation.
evidence:
  - path: "tests/common/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "fn new() -> Self"
    note: "Creates TempDir and runs git init for every test instance."
  - path: "tests/cli_commands.rs"
    loc:
      - "mod tests"
    note: "Contains 20+ tests each invoking TestContext::new()."
