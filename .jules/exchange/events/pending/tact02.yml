# Content
title: "Misplaced Operational Documentation"
statement: |
  The file `src/assets/templates/AGENTS.md` contains operational guides for the `jlo role create` command, which is volatile implementation detail rather than a strict execution policy for the directory. This violates the principle of excluding volatile implementation trivia from `AGENTS.md`.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/assets/templates/AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "31"
      - "42"
    note: "Contains 'Application' instructions and 'Relationship to jlo role create Command'."
