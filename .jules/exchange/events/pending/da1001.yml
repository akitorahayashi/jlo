title: "Inefficient Data Access in RequirementHeader::read"
statement: |
  RequirementHeader::read loads the entire file content into memory just to parse header fields.
  This is inefficient for large files or frequent reads, violating the principle of efficient data transformations.

evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/requirement.rs"
    loc:
      - "23-26"
    note: "Reads entire file content to parse headers."
