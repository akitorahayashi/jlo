title: "Ports Module Reduces Cohesion"
statement: |
  The ports module acts as a "horizontal" layer containing interfaces for disparate parts of the domain (Git, Setup, Jules Client), rather than grouping them by feature or change reason. This reduces cohesion and makes related code harder to find.
evidence:
  - path: "src/ports/mod.rs"

      pub use github::{GitHub, IssueInfo, PrComment, PullRequestDetail, PullRequestInfo};
      pub use jlo_store::{DiscoveredRole, JloStore};
      pub use setup_component_catalog::SetupComponentCatalog;
    note: "The ports module aggregates unrelated interfaces."
