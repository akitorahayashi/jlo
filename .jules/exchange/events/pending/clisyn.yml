title: "jlo run planner/implementer documentation contradicts CLI implementation"
statement: |
  The documentation shows the requirement file as a positional argument for planner and implementer commands.
  However, the CLI implementation in `src/app/cli/run.rs` defines it as a named argument `-r/--requirement`.
  Running the command as documented will fail.
evidence:
  - path: "README.md"
    loc:
      - "95"
    note: "Documents usage as a positional argument."
  - path: "src/app/cli/run.rs"
    loc:
      - "57"
      - "73"
    note: "Defines requirement as a named argument for Planner and Implementer."
