# Content
title: "ObserversLayer lacks execution logic tests"
statement: |
  ObserversLayer has no unit tests for its execution logic (execute_mock, execute_real) and lacks integration tests for prompt preview. This leaves the layer exposed to regressions and behavior drift.

# Evidence
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/layers/observers.rs"
    loc:
      - "1-260"
    note: "File lacks #[cfg(test)] module for unit tests."
  - path: "tests/cli/run/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "1-10"
    note: "No observers_prompt_preview_contract.rs found in integration tests."
