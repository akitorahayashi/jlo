# Content
title: "Generic Naming: Service Suffix"
statement: |
  The 'Service' suffix is used in `MockExecutionService`, which is a generic term that hides the specific responsibility of the type. This is an anti-pattern as per `role.yml` ("Vague names that hide responsibility").

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/run/mock/mock_execution.rs"
    loc:
      - "86"
    note: "`MockExecutionService` struct definition uses the generic 'Service' suffix."
