title: "Cyclic dependency between domain and ports modules"
statement: |
  The ports module (src/ports) depends on the domain module (src/domain) for the AppError type, while the domain module depends on the ports module for traits (e.g. JulesClient). This creates a cycle that prevents these layers from being cleanly separated or extracted.
evidence:
  - path: "src/ports/jules_client.rs"
    loc: ["3", "54"]
    note: "Imports and uses domain::AppError"
  - path: "src/domain/layers/execute/mod.rs"
    loc: ["6"]
    note: "Imports and uses ports::JulesClient"
