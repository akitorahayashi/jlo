title: "Duplicate TestContext Definitions"
statement: |
  `TestContext` is defined in both `tests/common/mod.rs` and `tests/harness/test_context.rs`, violating DRY and creating ambiguity about which harness to use.
evidence:
  - path: "tests/common/mod.rs"
    loc: ["pub struct TestContext {"]
    note: "Defines TestContext."
  - path: "tests/harness/test_context.rs"
    loc: ["pub(crate) struct TestContext {"]
    note: "Redefines TestContext."
