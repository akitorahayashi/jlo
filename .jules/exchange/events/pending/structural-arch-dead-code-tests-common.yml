title: "Dead code and duplicate functionality in tests/common"
statement: |
  tests/common/mod.rs contains a TestContext struct that is nearly identical to tests/harness/test_context.rs, but is marked #[allow(dead_code)] and appears unused. This duplication introduces maintenance overhead and confusion.
evidence:
  - path: "tests/common/mod.rs"
    loc: ["TestContext"]
    note: "Unused duplicate of harness functionality"
  - path: "tests/harness/test_context.rs"
    loc: ["TestContext"]
    note: "Canonical implementation of test harness"
