title: "Domain Purity Violation: mock_utils.rs Imports Adapters"
statement: |
  The `src/domain/layers/mock_utils.rs` file violates domain purity by importing `crate::adapters::workspace_filesystem::FilesystemWorkspaceStore` in its test module. Domain logic should rely on ports (traits) or mock implementations, not concrete adapters.

evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/layers/mock_utils.rs"
    loc:
      - "160-170"
    note: "Imports FilesystemWorkspaceStore in tests module"
