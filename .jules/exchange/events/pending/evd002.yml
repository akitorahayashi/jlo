title: "Implicit Global State Dependency in Configuration Loader"
statement: |
  `detect_repository_source` implicitly depends on global mutable state (`std::env::var`) as a fallback for repository detection. This violates "Boundary Sovereignty" by coupling the domain logic to the runtime environment, making testing fragile (requiring `serial` execution) and hiding dependencies.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/configuration/loader.rs"
    loc:
      - "71-73"
    note: "Implicit dependency on GITHUB_REPOSITORY environment variable."
