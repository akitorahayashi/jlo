title: "Missing Unit Tests for validate_requirement_path"
statement: |
  The function validate_requirement_path in src/domain/layers/execute/mod.rs performs critical path validation (path traversal, directory constraint) but lacks direct unit tests. This is a security risk as invalid paths or bypasses might go unnoticed.
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/layers/execute/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "28-59"
    note: "Function definition containing complex path validation logic without corresponding unit tests."
