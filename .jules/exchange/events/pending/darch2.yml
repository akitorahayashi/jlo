title: "RequirementHeader parses entire file"
statement: |
  RequirementHeader::read parses the entire file content as YAML to extract header fields. This is inefficient for large files and risks parsing errors if the body content is not valid YAML.

evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/requirement.rs"
    loc: ["28-29"]
    note: "Entire file content is parsed as YAML just to read the header."
