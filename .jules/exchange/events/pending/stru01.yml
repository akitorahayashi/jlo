title: "Inconsistent Command Module Structure"
statement: "Top-level commands in `src/app/commands/` mix file-based modules (`init.rs`) and directory-based modules (`add/`), violating predictable discovery principles."
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/init.rs"
    loc: ["pub fn execute()"]
    note: "File-based module for 'init' command."
  - path: "src/app/commands/add/"
    loc: ["mod.rs"]
    note: "Directory-based module for 'add' command."
