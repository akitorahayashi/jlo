title: "Inefficient full file read for partial header extraction"
statement: |
  The `RequirementHeader::read` method reads the entire file content into memory
  only to parse the header fields. For large requirement files, this is wasteful.
  Data flow should support streaming or partial reads (e.g., reading only the first N bytes
  or until a delimiter) to extract metadata efficiently without loading the full payload.
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/requirement.rs"
    loc:
      - "fn read"
    note: "Full file read for header parsing."
