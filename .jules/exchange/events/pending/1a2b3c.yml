title: "Flattened `docs/` structure violates architecture boundaries"
statement: |
  The `docs/` directory contains a flat mix of architectural definitions and operational guides, violating the memory requirement for subdirectories `docs/architecture/` and `docs/operations/`.
evidence:
  - path: "docs/ARCHITECTURE_BOUNDARY.md"
    loc: "1"
    note: "Architectural document at the root of `docs/` instead of `docs/architecture/`."
  - path: "docs/REPRODUCTION_GUIDE.md"
    loc: "1"
    note: "Operational guide at the root of `docs/` instead of `docs/operations/`."
