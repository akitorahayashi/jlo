title: "AGENTS.md incorrectly maps source layers directory to roles"

statement: |
  The `AGENTS.md` file (Section 2: Scaffold Mapping) states that `src/assets/scaffold/jules/layers`
  maps to `.jules/roles` in the deployed environment. However, the actual source directory in the
  repository is `src/assets/scaffold/jules/roles`, matching the destination name. The `layers` directory
  does not exist in the source scaffold.

evidence:
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "Section 2. Scaffold Mapping"
    note: "Documentation claims source directory is `src/assets/scaffold/jules/layers`."
  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/jules/roles/"
    loc:
      - "Directory exists"
    note: "Actual source directory is `src/assets/scaffold/jules/roles/`."
