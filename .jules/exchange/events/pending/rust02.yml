title: "Excessive cloning in ComponentGraph resolution."
statement: |
  `ComponentGraph::resolve` clones `Component` structs when building the `needed` map and `in_degree` map. This is inefficient and bypasses ownership design.

  Refactor `ComponentGraph` to use references or `Rc<Component>` during the resolution phase. Only clone when transferring ownership to the final result, or better, return a structure that borrows from the catalog if possible.
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/component_graph.rs"
    loc: ["15-100"]
    note: "ComponentGraph::resolve clones Component structs and keys extensively."
