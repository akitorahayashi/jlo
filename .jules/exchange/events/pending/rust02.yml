title: "Monolithic `AppError` Anti-pattern"
statement: |
  The `AppError` enum is a monolithic error type that couples unrelated domains (IO, Git, Config, API, etc.), violating separation of concerns. It also relies on stringly-typed variants like `Validation(String)` and `InternalError(String)`, which lose semantic meaning and make error handling fragile.
