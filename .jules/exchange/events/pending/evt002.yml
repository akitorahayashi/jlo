title: Excessive Nesting in `jlo workflow` Commands
statement: |
  The `jlo workflow` command structure has proliferated into deeply nested subcommands, reaching 5 levels of depth (e.g., `jlo workflow gh process issue label-innovator`). This complexity degrades discoverability and usability, forcing users to navigate a deep hierarchy for routine operations. The command structure should be flattened or reorganized to improve accessibility.
evidence:
  - path: src/app/cli/workflow.rs
    loc: ["186"]
    note: "Deeply nested LabelInnovator command structure."
