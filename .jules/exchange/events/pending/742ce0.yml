title: "Undocumented Integrator layer and aliases in run command"
statement: |
  The `jlo run` command implementation includes an `Integrator` layer (alias `g`) and plural aliases (e.g., `deciders`, `planners`) for all layers, which are completely omitted from the `README.md` documentation. The documentation implies only specific layers are supported and lists only single-letter aliases.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/cli/run.rs"
    loc:
      - "103"
    note: "Implementation of Integrator layer with alias 'g' and 'integrators'"

    loc:
      - "43"
      - "53"
      - "62"
      - "71"
    note: "Implementation of plural aliases for other layers (deciders, planners, implementers)"

  - path: "README.md"
    loc:
      - "37"
      - "78"
    note: "Documentation lists `jlo run <layer>` and aliases but omits Integrator and plural forms"
