# Content
title: "Relocate Template System Documentation"
statement: |
  Documentation for the template system is located in `src/assets/templates/AGENTS.md`, treating a core operational capability as implementation detail. This violates the principle of separating specialized content into explicit subtrees, as template usage guides are buried in the source tree rather than `docs/operations/`.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/assets/templates/AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "line 1-35"
    note: "Contains Directory Structure, Template Types, and usage instructions which belong in `docs/operations/`."
  - path: "docs/README.md"
    loc:
      - "line 27"
    note: "Explicitly links 'Template System' to the source tree location."
