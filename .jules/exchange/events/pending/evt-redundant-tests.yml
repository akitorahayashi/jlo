title: Consolidate redundant command integration tests
statement: |
  The test file `tests/commands_core.rs` tests the same library functions (`init_at`, `create_role_at`) that are thoroughly exercised via the CLI in `tests/cli_commands.rs`. This duplication increases maintenance overhead without adding significant coverage or diagnosability.

    note: "Entire file duplicates scenarios covered in cli_commands.rs"

    note: "Equivalent coverage exists in test_cli_lifecycle and create_role_fails_without_workspace"
