title: "Monolithic AppError Enum"
statement: |
  The `AppError` enum is a monolithic error type that mixes I/O, configuration, domain logic, and external tool errors. This makes it difficult to handle specific error cases gracefully and increases the coupling between unrelated modules.
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/error.rs"
    loc: "14-167"
    note: "Single `AppError` enum contains over 30 variants spanning all domain concerns."
