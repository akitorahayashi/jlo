title: "Undocumented workflow commands and flags"
statement: |
  The `jlo workflow` command implementation includes `bootstrap` and `doctor` subcommands which are entirely missing from the `README.md` command reference. Additionally, the `jlo workflow run` command supports `--mock` and `--task` flags which are not documented.
