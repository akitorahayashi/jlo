title: "Systemic risk from mock-centric testing strategy"
statement: |
  The testing strategy heavily favors `execute_mock`, which verifies local file operations and git commands but bypasses the core value proposition: AI interaction via the API. This creates a false sense of security where "tests pass" but production code might fail on basic API contract violations.
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/layers/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "trait LayerStrategy"
    note: "Interface encourages separation, but implementations (implementer.rs, decider.rs) lack tests for the real implementation."
