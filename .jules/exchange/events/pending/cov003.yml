title: "Security-critical requirement path validation is untested"
statement: |
  The `validate_requirement_path` function enforces that requirement files must reside within the designated `.jules/exchange/requirements/` directory. This security and correctness constraint has complex logic (canonicalization, component checking) but zero test coverage, leaving it vulnerable to regression or bypass.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/layers/execute/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "validate_requirement_path"
    note: "Function implements security constraint but lacks tests."
