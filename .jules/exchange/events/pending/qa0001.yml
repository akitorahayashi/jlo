# Content
title: "Missing unit test coverage for Planner and Observers layers"
statement: |
  The PlannerLayer and ObserversLayer structs implement LayerStrategy but lack dedicated unit tests for their execution logic, unlike DeciderLayer and ImplementerLayer.

# Evidence
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/layers/planner.rs"
    loc: ["no-tests"]
    note: "No #[cfg(test)] module or associated unit tests found."

  - path: "src/domain/layers/observers.rs"
    loc: ["no-tests"]
    note: "No #[cfg(test)] module or associated unit tests found."
