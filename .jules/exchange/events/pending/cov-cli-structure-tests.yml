title: "Lack of structural and consistency tests for CLI commands"
statement: |
  The CLI command suite is expanding (`jlo run`, `jlo workflow`, etc.) without a dedicated testing
  layer for interface consistency. Tests in `tests/cli/` focus on functional correctness but do not
  enforce standards for argument naming, help message formatting, or output structure (SVO).
  This creates a risk of UX degradation and inconsistency as new commands are added.
evidence: |
  - `tests/cli/run/`: Contains functional integration tests but no structural assertions.
  - `src/app/commands/`: No centralized test suite enforcing CLI design patterns.
  - Absence of a `cli_sentinel` or similar mechanism in the test harness.
