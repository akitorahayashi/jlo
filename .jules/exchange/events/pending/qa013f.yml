title: "Critical Integration Gap: Missing E2E tests for mock execution"
statement: |
  The repository lacks end-to-end integration tests for the `jlo run --mock` command, which is a critical path for verifying developer workflows. Existing tests only cover argument parsing or unit-test the mock logic with mocked git dependencies.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "tests/cli/run/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "module list"
    note: "Contains only prompt preview and validation tests, no execution tests."

  - path: "tests/mock/mock_mode_contract.rs"
    loc:
      - "file content"
    note: "Only validates CLI arguments and environment variables."

  - path: "src/domain/layers/decider.rs"
    loc:
      - "mod tests"
    note: "Unit tests use FakeGit/FakeGitHub, bypassing real git interactions."
