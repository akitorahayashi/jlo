title: "Undocumented and Duplicated .agents/ Directory Structure"
statement: |
  The `.agents/` directory structure exhibits two critical issues:
  1. **Undocumented Existence**: The directory exists in both the repository root (`.agents/`) and within the control plane (`.jlo/roles/.agents/`), but neither location is documented in the authoritative `AGENTS.md` (Design Overview) or `src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md`. This creates a gap in structural context and potential ambiguity regarding ownership and scope.
  2. **Content Duplication**: The `create-jlo-innovator` and `create-jlo-observer` skills are duplicated across both locations, violating the "Single Source of Truth" principle and creating potential for divergence.
