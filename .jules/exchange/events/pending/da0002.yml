# Content
title: "Leaky Validation in Control Plane Adapter"
statement: |
  Domain validation logic for `WorkflowGenerateConfig` (e.g., cron schedule validation) is implemented in `src/adapters/control_plane_config.rs`, rather than within the domain model itself. This results in an anemic domain model (`WorkflowGenerateConfig` is a plain struct) and risks invalid configurations being created if the adapter is bypassed.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/adapters/control_plane_config.rs"
    loc:
      - "38-65"
    note: "load_workflow_generate_config validates cron entries and wait_minutes_default."
  - path: "src/domain/config/workflow_generate.rs"
    loc:
      - "6-17"
    note: "WorkflowGenerateConfig is a public struct with no validation methods."
