title: "Missing Domain Model and Validation for Observer Perspectives"
statement: |
  While Innovator perspectives are modeled (`src/domain/workstations/perspectives/model.rs`) and validated by `jlo doctor` (`src/app/commands/doctor/schema.rs`), Observer perspectives lack a corresponding domain model and validation logic. This leads to an inconsistent system where Observer configuration is untyped and potentially invalid.
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/workstations/perspectives/model.rs"
    loc: ["1"]
    note: "Missing ObserverPerspective struct definition"
  - path: "src/app/commands/doctor/schema.rs"
    loc: ["150"]
    note: "Missing validation call for observer perspectives in schema_checks"
