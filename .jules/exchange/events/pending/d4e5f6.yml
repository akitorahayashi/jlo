title: "Unenforced Domain Architecture Rules"
statement: |
  `src/domain/layers/mock_utils.rs` (in tests) imports `crate::adapters::workspace_filesystem::FilesystemWorkspaceStore`, violating the explicit prohibition of `crate::adapters` in `src/domain/AGENTS.md`. The rule exists but lacks enforcement via CI or compiler checks, allowing gradual erosion of the "Pure Logic" boundary.
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "Dependencies section"
    note: "Explicitly forbids crate::adapters"
  - path: "src/domain/layers/mock_utils.rs"
    loc:
      - "use crate::adapters::workspace_filesystem::FilesystemWorkspaceStore"
    note: "Import used in tests, violating architectural purity"
