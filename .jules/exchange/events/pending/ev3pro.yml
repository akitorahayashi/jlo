title: "Weak Proposal Domain Model Validation"
statement: |
  The `Proposal` struct in `src/domain/exchange/proposals/model.rs` uses `#[serde(default)]` for all fields, masking missing data during deserialization.
  Validation is deferred to the consumer (`publish_proposals` command), creating a risk of inconsistent data if the model is reused or validation logic drifts.
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/exchange/proposals/model.rs"
    loc: ["12"]
    note: "All fields use `#[serde(default)]` without strict schema enforcement."
  - path: "src/app/commands/workflow/exchange/publish_proposals.rs"
    loc: ["100"]
    note: "Validation is performed manually in the command handler."
