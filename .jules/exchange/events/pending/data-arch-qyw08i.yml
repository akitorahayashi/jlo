title: "Dead Configuration Code"
statement: |
  WorkflowTimingConfig struct in RunConfig is marked with `#[allow(dead_code)]` and has no validation logic.
  This suggests incomplete implementation or dead code that should be removed or properly implemented.

evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/configuration/run_config.rs"
    loc: ["155"]
    note: "Struct marked as dead code."
