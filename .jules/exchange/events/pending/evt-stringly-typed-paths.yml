# Content
title: "Stringly-Typed Path Logic in Manifest"
statement: |
  `src/domain/workspace/manifest.rs` uses fragile string splitting and index checking to validate file paths, instead of leveraging the `Path` API or the type-safe constants in `domain::workspace::paths`.
  This approach is brittle and prone to errors if path structures change.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/workspace/manifest.rs"
    loc:
      - "44-55"
      - "59-75"
    note: "Uses manual path splitting and index checks in `is_default_role_file` and `is_control_plane_entity_file`."
