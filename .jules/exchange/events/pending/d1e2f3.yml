title: "Manual Workflows Excluded from Linting"
statement: |
  The `run-linters` workflow explicitly targets only the generated workflows in `.tmp/`, leaving manual workflows (build.yml, release.yml, etc.) unlinted. This creates a risk of syntax errors and security issues in critical manual workflows.
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/run-linters.yml"
    loc:
      - "44-46"
    note: "actionlint command restricted to .tmp/workflow-scaffold-generate/..."
