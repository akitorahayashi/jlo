title: Monolithic Mock Logic Bypassing Domain Abstractions
statement: |
  The `execute_mock` functions in layer strategies (e.g., `DeciderLayer`, `ObserversLayer`) contain monolithic, imperative logic that manually manipulates files and git state, bypassing domain abstractions and duplicating implementation details across layers.
evidence:
  - path: src/domain/layers/decider.rs
    loc:
      - "123-322"
    note: "`execute_mock` contains 200 lines of complex procedural logic, manually constructing YAML strings and handling git operations, bypassing the domain model."
  - path: src/domain/layers/observers.rs
    loc:
      - "181-286"
    note: "Similar duplicated procedural complexity in `ObserversLayer::execute_mock`."
