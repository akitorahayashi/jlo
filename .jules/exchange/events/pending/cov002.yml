title: "Zero coverage on exchange path infrastructure"
statement: |
  The `events` and `requirements` modules define critical file system paths for the exchange mechanism but have 0% unit test coverage. While simple, these paths are foundational to the workflow and any error here would cause silent failures or misrouting of artifacts.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/exchange/events/paths.rs"
    loc:
      - "1-20"
    note: "Core event path functions are untested."
  - path: "src/domain/exchange/requirements/paths.rs"
    loc:
      - "1-10"
    note: "Core requirement path functions are untested."
