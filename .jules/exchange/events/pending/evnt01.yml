title: "Inconsistent Command Module Structure"
statement: |
  The `src/app/commands/` directory mixes file-based command modules (`init.rs`, `update.rs`) with directory-based command modules (`add/`, `create/`). This violates the principle of "Naming shape consistency across boundaries".

evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub mod add;"
      - "pub mod init;"
    note: "Simultaneous export of directory-based and file-based modules."
  - path: "src/app/commands/init.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub fn execute"
    note: "File-based command module."
  - path: "src/app/commands/add/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "mod role;"
    note: "Directory-based command module."
