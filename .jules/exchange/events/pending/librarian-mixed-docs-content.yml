title: "Operational Guides directory mixes user and internal dev content"
statement: |
  The `docs/` directory contains both high-level user guides (`CONTROL_PLANE_OWNERSHIP.md`)
  and low-level internal dev maps (`WORKFLOW_BRANCH_IMPACT_MAP.md`). This violates responsibility
  separation and increases cognitive load for users seeking operational guidance.

evidence:
  - path: "docs/CONTROL_PLANE_OWNERSHIP.md"
    loc: ["1"]
    note: "High-level architecture guide intended for users/operators."
  - path: "docs/WORKFLOW_BRANCH_IMPACT_MAP.md"
    loc: ["1"]
    note: "Low-level internal reference for workflow developers."
