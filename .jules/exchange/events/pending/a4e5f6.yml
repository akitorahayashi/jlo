# Content
title: "Misplaced Architectural Principles in Root AGENTS.md"
statement: |
  The root `AGENTS.md` file contains core architectural definitions ("Critical Design Principles", "Scaffold Mapping", "Worker Branch Merge Policy") that belong in the `docs/architecture/` directory. `AGENTS.md` should function as a high-level directive for agents, delegating specific architectural rules to their canonical documents to avoid "Mixed document responsibilities".

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "12"
    note: "Defines 'Critical Design Principles' directly in the root file"
  - path: "docs/architecture/"
    loc:
      - "1"
    note: "Existing architecture directory where these principles should reside"
