title: "Monolithic AppError dilutes domain meaning."
statement: |
  `AppError` flattens all possible failure modes into a single type, forcing callers to handle or ignore irrelevant variants. This violates "Errors are part of the contract".

  Decompose `AppError` into domain-specific error types (e.g., `WorkflowError`, `ConfigError`, `GitError`) to provide clearer boundaries and context. Use libraries like `thiserror` for library code and `anyhow` for application entry points if appropriate, but avoid losing type information where it matters.
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/error.rs"
    loc: ["1-200"]
    note: "AppError is a monolithic enum aggregating IO, Git, Parse, and validation errors."
