# Content
title: "Missing Explicit Validation for RunConfig"
statement: |
  `RunConfig` objects are populated via `RunConfigDto` using `unwrap_or` defaults, but there is no step to validate the semantic correctness of the values.
  Issues like negative timeouts (if types allowed), zero max_parallel, or empty strings where not allowed are not caught at the boundary.
  This contrasts with `Schedule::validate` which enforces constraints.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/run/config_dto.rs"
    loc:
      - "impl From<RunConfigDto> for RunConfig"
    note: "Performs structural conversion and default injection but no value validation."

  - path: "src/domain/configuration/run_config.rs"
    loc:
      - "struct RunConfig"
    note: "Data container without associated validation methods."

  - path: "src/domain/configuration/schedule.rs"
    loc:
      - "fn validate(&self)"
    note: "Example of proper validation pattern used elsewhere in the domain."
