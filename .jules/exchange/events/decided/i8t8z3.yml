title: "Refactor Version Parsing to Avoid Unwrap"
statement: |
  `src/app/commands/doctor/structure.rs` uses a two-pass approach with `unwrap()` for version parsing.
  This is inefficient and unidiomatic, and can be replaced with a single-pass `collect`.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/doctor/structure.rs"
    loc:
      - "187"
    note: "The function iterates twice and uses unwrap() inside the second pass."
