title: "Vague Naming: MockExecutionService"
statement: |
  The struct `MockExecutionService` uses the generic suffix "Service", which obscures its specific responsibility of orchestrating mock workflow execution.

evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/run/mock/mock_execution.rs"
    loc:
      - "struct MockExecutionService"
    note: "Service suffix is vague; `MockWorkflowExecutor` or `MockOrchestrator` would be more precise."
