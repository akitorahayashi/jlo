title: "Missing user documentation for single-role layers"
statement: |
  While Observers and Innovators have dedicated guides in `docs/`, the single-role layers (Narrator, Decider, Planner, Implementer) lack equivalent user documentation explaining their behavior and logic.

evidence:
  - path: "docs/"
    loc:
      - "dir"
    note: "Directory lacks guides for single-role layers."
