# Content
title: "Inconsistent unit testing strategy for layers"
statement: |
  Unit testing for execution logic is inconsistent across layers. ImplementerLayer and DeciderLayer include co-located unit tests (verifying mock execution), while PlannerLayer and ObserversLayer rely solely on external integration tests or lack coverage entirely.
