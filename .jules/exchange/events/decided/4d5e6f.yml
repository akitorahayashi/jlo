title: "Missing `docs/README.md` index"
statement: |
  The `docs/` directory lacks a `README.md` entry point, relying instead on `AGENTS.md` (root) or `docs/AGENTS.md` for navigation, creating ambiguity and violating the "One canonical path" principle.
evidence:
  - path: "docs/"
    loc: ["1"]
    note: "Listing `docs/` confirms the absence of `README.md`."
