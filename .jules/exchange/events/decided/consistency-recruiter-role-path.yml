title: "Recruiter role definition points to invalid path"
statement: |
  The `recruiter` role is instructed to analyze role definitions in `.jules/roles/observers/*/role.yml` and `.jules/roles/innovators/*/role.yml`. However, repository inspection confirms that active role instances reside in `.jlo/roles/`, while `.jules/roles/` contains only system contracts and schemas. This misdirection prevents the role from accessing the files it is designed to analyze.

evidence:
  - path: ".jlo/roles/innovators/recruiter/role.yml"
    loc: ["7", "31"]
    note: "The `analysis_points` and `evidence_expectations` fields direct the agent to `.jules/roles/`."
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc: ["Critical Design Principles", "Prompt Hierarchy"]
    note: "Documentation correctly identifies `.jlo/roles/` as the location for role definitions."
