title: "Structural Drift: Layer vs. Role Naming"
statement: |
  The source code and scaffold templates use "layers" as the primary organizational unit (e.g., `src/assets/scaffold/jules/layers`), but the deployed scaffold organizes by "roles" (`.jules/roles`). This creates a mental model mismatch for developers working across the boundary.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/jules/layers"
    loc:
      - "1"
    note: "Source directory uses `layers`"
  - path: ".jules/roles"
    loc:
      - "1"
    note: "Deployed directory uses `roles`"
  - path: "src/domain/layers/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "1-10"
    note: "Source code uses `layers` module"
