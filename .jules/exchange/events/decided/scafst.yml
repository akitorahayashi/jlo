title: "Scaffold directory structure in AGENTS.md does not match implementation"
statement: |
  The documentation describes a `.jules/roles/` directory structure for the scaffold.
  However, the actual scaffold assets in `src/assets/scaffold/jules/` use a `layers/` directory.
  This leads to confusion about where to find layer-specific assets and inconsistency in references.
evidence:
  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "128-135"
    note: "References .jules/roles/ directory structure."
  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/jules"
    loc:
      - "layers/"
    note: "Actual directory is named 'layers', not 'roles'."
