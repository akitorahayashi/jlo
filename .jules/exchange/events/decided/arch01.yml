title: "Stringly Typed Git and GitHub Adapters"
statement: |
  The `GitCommandAdapter` and `GitHubCommandAdapter` rely on constructing shell commands via strings and parsing stdout/stderr strings. This is brittle, prone to injection or parsing errors, and loses type safety.
evidence:
  - path: "src/adapters/git_command.rs"
    loc:
      - "run method"
    note: "Constructs git commands from string slices and parses output as string."
  - path: "src/adapters/github_command.rs"
    loc:
      - "create_pull_request method"
    note: "Parses PR URL from stdout string to extract PR number, which is fragile."
