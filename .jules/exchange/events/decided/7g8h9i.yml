title: "Split indexing responsibility between root `AGENTS.md` and `docs/AGENTS.md`"
statement: |
  Both `AGENTS.md` (root) and `docs/AGENTS.md` claim indexing authority for `docs/` content, creating conflicting navigation paths.
evidence:
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc: ["1"]
    note: "Root index includes links to specialized docs, partially acting as the documentation home."
  - path: "docs/AGENTS.md"
    loc: ["1"]
    note: "Specialized index also claims 'Core Documentation' indexing, creating redundancy."
