title: "Unused Fields in MockExecutionService"
statement: |
  The `MockExecutionService` struct in `src/domain/layers/mock_utils.rs` has fields `jules_path`, `config`, and `workspace` marked as `#[allow(dead_code)]`. This indicates incomplete implementation, maintenance debt, or over-engineering.

evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/layers/mock_utils.rs"
    loc:
      - "85-95"
    note: "Struct definition with unused fields"
