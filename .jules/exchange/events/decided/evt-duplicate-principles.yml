# Content
title: "Duplicate Design Principles"
statement: |
  `src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md` duplicates "Prompt Hierarchy" and "Workflow-Driven Execution" principles from `AGENTS.md` (root). These are also referenced in `src/assets/templates/AGENTS.md`. Consolidation to the root `AGENTS.md` is better for token efficiency and preventing drift.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "18-35"
    note: "Root definition of design principles."
  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "5-20"
    note: "Duplicate definition of design principles."
