title: "Missing Integration Tests for jlo workflow run"
statement: |
  The `jlo workflow run` command is a critical orchestration entry point but has no corresponding integration tests in `tests/workflow/`.
  The test suite only covers `bootstrap`, `doctor`, and `scaffold`, leaving the core execution logic unverified against regressions.
evidence:
  - path: "tests/workflow/mod.rs"
    loc: ["1"]
    note: "File listing shows only bootstrap, doctor, and scaffold modules."
  - path: "src/app/cli/workflow.rs"
    loc: ["1"]
    note: "Command definition shows run subcommand exists."
