# Content
title: "Missing tests/AGENTS.md Contract"
statement: |
  The `tests/` directory lacks a scoped `AGENTS.md` contract, relying on implicit knowledge for integration test patterns and fixture usage.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "tests/"
    loc:
      - "dir"
    note: "Directory exists but lacks AGENTS.md file."
