# Content
title: "Scope Violation in src/testing/AGENTS.md"
statement: |
  src/testing/AGENTS.md asserts authority over tests/ structure, violating scope locality principles.
  It attempts to define where integration tests belong, contradicting tests/AGENTS.md.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/testing/AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "lines 12-13"
    note: "Attempts to govern tests/harness/ usage from src/testing/ scope."
  - path: "tests/AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "lines 18-20"
    note: "Defines the actual structure for integration tests."
