title: "Inefficient Requirement Header Parsing"
statement: |
  RequirementHeader::read reads the entire file content into memory to parse just the header.
  This is inefficient for large requirement files and violates the principle of accessing only needed data.

evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/requirement.rs"
    loc: ["26"]
    note: "Reads entire file content before parsing header."
