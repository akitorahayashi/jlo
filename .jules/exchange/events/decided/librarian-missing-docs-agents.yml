title: "Missing AGENTS.md in docs/"
statement: |
  The `docs/` directory lacks an `AGENTS.md` or `README.md` to explain its structure and the purpose of the files within it. This omission hinders navigability and violates the principle of "Documentation Is Navigation Infrastructure".
evidence:
  - path: "docs/"
    loc:
      - "dir"
    note: "Directory exists but lacks explanatory documentation."
