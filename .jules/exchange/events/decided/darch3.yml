title: "Manifest logic coupled to path indices"
statement: |
  is_default_role_file and is_control_plane_entity_file rely on hardcoded path component indices, making the logic brittle to directory structure changes.

evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/workspace/manifest.rs"
    loc: ["63-67"]
    note: "Logic relies on hardcoded path indices and fixed depth."
