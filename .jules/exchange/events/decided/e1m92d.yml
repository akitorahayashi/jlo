# Content
title: "Missing Integrator Layer Documentation"
statement: |
  The `integrator` layer is fully implemented and discoverable via `jlo run`, but lacks a corresponding operational guide in `docs/operations/layers/`. The `docs/README.md` index also omits it.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/cli/run.rs"
    loc:
      - "RunLayer::Integrator"
    note: "Defines the Integrator layer command variant."

  - path: "docs/operations/layers/"
    loc:
      - "(missing INTEGRATOR.md)"
    note: "Operational guide for the integrator layer is absent."

  - path: "docs/README.md"
    loc:
      - "Operations"
    note: "Integrator layer is not listed in the documentation index."
