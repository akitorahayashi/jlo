title: "Critical coverage gap in Decider production execution"
statement: |
  The `DeciderLayer::execute_real` function is similarly uncovered. It orchestrates critical decision workflows via the API, but tests only validate the mock scaffolding logic.
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/layers/decider.rs"
    loc:
      - "fn execute_real"
    note: "Production logic for event processing and API calls is untested."
