title: "Semantic Collision: Update vs Upgrade"
statement: |
  The term "update" is overloaded. `jlo update` (implemented in `src/app/commands/update.rs`) updates the workspace control plane. `jlo update --cli` (implemented in `src/app/commands/cli_upgrade.rs`) upgrades the binary. The internal module name `cli_upgrade` conflicts with the public command name `update`.

    note: "Implements workspace update logic."

    note: "Implements binary upgrade logic."
  - path: "src/app/cli/mod.rs"
    loc:

      - "cli: bool,"
    note: "Overloads 'update' command to handle both concepts."
