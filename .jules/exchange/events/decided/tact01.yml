# Content
title: "Misplaced Architecture Documentation"
statement: |
  The file `src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md` contains core architectural definitions (Concepts, Directory Structure, Flow) that belong in `docs/architecture/` or the root `AGENTS.md`. This violates the principle of scope-local rule placement and creates a global contract in a local directory.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "6"
      - "12"
      - "59"
    note: "Contains 'Concepts', 'Directory Structure', and 'Flow' sections defining global architecture."
