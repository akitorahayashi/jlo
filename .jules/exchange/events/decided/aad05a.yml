title: "GitCommandAdapter lacks dedicated contract tests"
statement: |
  The `GitCommandAdapter` implementation in `src/adapters/git/git_command.rs` lacks dedicated unit or contract tests. Its correctness is only verified indirectly through broad integration tests, leaving edge cases (like command failures, weird output, or specific git versions) potentially uncovered.
evidence:
  - path: "src/adapters/git/git_command.rs"
    loc:
      - "1"
    note: "File lacks #[cfg(test)] module and no corresponding test file found in tests/adapters."
