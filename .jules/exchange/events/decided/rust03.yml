title: "Test Double Duplication in Run Command"
statement: |
  The `run` command module defines its own `TestGit` and `TestGitHub` structs in `src/app/commands/run/mod.rs`, duplicating logic that should be shared via `src/testing/` or a common test harness. This violates DRY and increases maintenance burden.

  - path: "src/app/commands/run/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "225-360"
    note: "Local definition of `TestGit` and `TestGitHub`"
