# Content
title: "Terminology Collision: 'roles' directory used for Layer Definitions"
statement: |
  The `.jules/roles` directory contains Layer definitions (e.g. `observers`, `narrator`), while `.jlo/roles` contains Role instances. This violates "One Concept, One Preferred Term" and creates confusion about whether a directory contains architectural Layers or specific Role personas. Additionally, `AGENTS.md` incorrectly claims a "renaming (layers -> roles)" step that does not exist in the code (it is a direct copy).

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: ".jules/roles/observers/observers_prompt.j2"
    loc:
      - "1"
    note: "Layer-level artifact found in 'roles' directory."

  - path: ".jlo/roles/observers/taxonomy/role.yml"
    loc:
      - "1"
    note: "Role-level artifact found in 'roles' directory."

  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "21-23"
    note: "Section 2 claims 'renaming (layers -> roles)' occurs, but source structure already uses 'roles'."
