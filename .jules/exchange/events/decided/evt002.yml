title: "Slow Feedback Loop due to Compilation Time"
statement: |
  The compilation time for the project is significantly high (> 1 minute), which hinders the "fast inner loop" principle of test-driven development.
evidence:
  - path: "Cargo.toml"
    loc: ["1"]
    note: "Project dependencies or structure lead to slow compilation (1m 12s observed)."
