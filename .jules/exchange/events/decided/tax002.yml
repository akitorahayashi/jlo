title: "Ambiguous Configuration Naming"
statement: |
  The top-level configuration type is named `RunConfig`, which implies it only covers the `[run]` section.
  However, it serves as the root object for the entire control plane configuration, including `[workflow]`
  and `[jules_api]`. This naming hides the scope of the configuration object.
  A more appropriate name would be `ControlPlaneConfig` or `AppConfig`.
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/config/run.rs"
    loc:
      - "11"
    note: "Definition of `RunConfig` struct containing multiple sections."
  - path: "src/domain/config/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "12"
    note: "Export of `RunConfig` as the primary configuration type."
