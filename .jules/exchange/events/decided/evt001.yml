  Documentation structure is ambiguous.

title: "Documentation Navigation Ambiguity and Clutter"
evidence:
  - path: "docs/AGENTS.md"
    loc: ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]
    note: "File is an index, not an agent guide, creating routing confusion."
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc: ["1"]
    note: "Root AGENTS.md conflicts with src/AGENTS.md as canonical guide."
  - path: "docs/WORKFLOW_BRANCH_IMPACT_MAP.md"
    loc: ["1"]
    note: "Operational map clutters high-level docs namespace."
