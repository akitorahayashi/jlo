title: Mandatory Option Inconsistency in `jlo run` Subcommands
statement: |
  The `jlo run` command exhibits inconsistent argument handling across subcommands. `Observers` and `Innovators` require a mandatory `--role` option for their primary target, whereas `Planner` and `Implementer` accept their primary target (`requirement`) as a positional argument. This violates the principle that mandatory information should be positional unless justified by an exception, and creates a fragmented user experience.
evidence:
  - path: src/app/cli/run.rs
    loc: ["25"]
    note: "Observers command defines role as a mandatory named argument (flag)."
  - path: src/app/cli/run.rs
    loc: ["54"]
    note: "Planner command defines requirement as a positional argument."
  - path: src/app/cli/run.rs

    note: "Innovators command defines role as a mandatory named argument (flag)."
