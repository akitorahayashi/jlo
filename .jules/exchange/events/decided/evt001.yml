title: "Domain Logic Leaks Side Effects in Policy"
statement: |
  The domain layer contains logic that directly accesses the filesystem, violating the architectural principle of purity.
  Specifically, `src/domain/layers/execute/policy.rs` imports `std::fs` and performs directory reads.
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/layers/execute/policy.rs"
    loc: ["15-29"]
    note: "Function `has_pending_events` calls `std::fs::read_dir` directly."
