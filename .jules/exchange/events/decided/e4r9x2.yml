# Content
title: "Decompose Monolithic AppError"
statement: |
  The `AppError` enum has grown into a "God Object" mixing unrelated concerns (IO, Git, Domain, Configuration, Exchange).
  This violates the "Errors are part of the contract" principle by forcing all layers to depend on all error types,
  reducing modularity and losing domain meaning at boundaries.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/error.rs"
    loc:
      - "23"
    note: "The AppError enum definition includes variants for unrelated domains (Io, Git, JulesApi, Setup, Exchange)."
