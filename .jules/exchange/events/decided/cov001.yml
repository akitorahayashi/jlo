title: "Uncovered Critical Path in Run Command"
statement: |
  The `execute_real` functions in `DeciderLayer` and `ImplementerLayer` contain the core production logic for interacting with the Jules API and assembling prompts. However, the existing tests in `src/app/commands/run/layer/decider.rs` and `src/app/commands/run/layer/implementer.rs` exclusively cover the `execute_mock` path. This leaves the actual production code path completely untested at the unit level, increasing the risk of regressions in critical functionality like session creation and prompt assembly.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/run/layer/decider.rs"
    loc:
      - "fn execute_real"
    note: "Contains critical API interaction logic but is not invoked by any test in the file."
  - path: "src/app/commands/run/layer/implementer.rs"
    loc:
      - "fn execute_real"
    note: "Contains critical API interaction logic but is not invoked by any test in the file."
