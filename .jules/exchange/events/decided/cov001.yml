title: "Critical coverage gap in Implementer production execution"
statement: |
  The `ImplementerLayer::execute_real` function, which handles actual API interaction and session creation, is not covered by unit tests. Tests exclusively cover `execute_mock` or `prompt_preview`, leaving critical production logic unverified.
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/layers/implementer.rs"
    loc:
      - "fn execute_real"
    note: "Contains core logic for API client creation and session execution, completely absent from unit tests."
