# Content
title: "Repository Detection Logic Unverified"
statement: |
  The `detect_repository_source` function in `src/app/commands/run/config.rs` contains complex
  precedence logic (Git config vs Env var) and failure modes that are not covered by unit tests.
  Failures in repository detection in different environments (e.g., CI vs Local) may go unnoticed.

# Evidence
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/run/config.rs"
    loc:
      - "detect_repository_source"
    note: "Relies on git command execution without unit test coverage for failure or precedence logic."
