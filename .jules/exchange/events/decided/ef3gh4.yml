title: "Monolithic AppError Enum Violates Separation of Concerns"
statement: |
  The `AppError` enum is a monolithic container for unrelated error domains (IO, Git, Jules API, Configuration, Validation, Setup). This design increases compilation scope (any change to `AppError` rebuilds dependents), makes error handling coarse (handling `GitError` requires importing `JulesApiError`), and leads to broad matching arms. It fails to preserve domain meaning as errors propagate, often converting them to generic strings or overly broad categories.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/error.rs"
    loc:
      - "26" # Io
      - "187" # GitError
      - "34" # JulesApiError
      - "175" # RequirementFileNotFound
    note: "AppError mixes low-level infrastructure errors (Git, IO) with high-level domain errors (Requirement, Setup)."
