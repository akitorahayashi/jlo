# Content
title: "Inconsistent Terminology: 'Issue' vs 'Requirement'"
statement: |
  The codebase uses "Issue" in Layer descriptions and method names (`emit issues`, `is_issue_driven`), while domain entities and file paths use "Requirement".
  The domain term appears to be "Requirement" (stored in `.jules/exchange/requirements/`), so "Issue" is likely a legacy term or refers to GitHub Issues specifically, causing confusion about internal representation.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/layers/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "98"
    note: "Layer::Decider description uses 'emit issues'."
  - path: "src/domain/layers/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "156"
    note: "Layer::is_issue_driven method name uses 'issue'."
  - path: "src/domain/exchange/requirements/header.rs"
    loc:
      - "10"
    note: "Domain entity is named RequirementHeader."
