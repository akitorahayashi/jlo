title: "Prompt Assembly Violates Boundary Sovereignty via Filesystem Writes"
statement: |
  The prompt assembly domain logic, specifically `IncludeContext::seed_from_schema` in `src/domain/prompt_assemble/assembler.rs`, performs side-effects (writing files to disk) during what should be a pure read-only template rendering process. This violates the principle of Boundary Sovereignty and mixes domain logic with operational concerns (seeding files).
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/prompt_assemble/assembler.rs"
    loc: ["228"]
    note: "seed_from_schema method performs filesystem writes"
