title: "Low Cohesion in `src/adapters` Root"
statement: |
  The `src/adapters` directory contains unrelated modules (`control_plane_config.rs`, `workflow_installer.rs`) at its root, turning it into a 'bag of things'. These modules should be grouped by their functional purpose (e.g., `src/adapters/config`, `src/adapters/install`) to improve cohesion and findability.

# Evidence supporting the observation
# For multi-file events, add multiple list items.
