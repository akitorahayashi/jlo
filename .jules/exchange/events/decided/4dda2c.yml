# Content
title: "Missing src/domain/AGENTS.md Contract"
statement: |
  The `src/domain/` directory contains core logic but lacks a scoped `AGENTS.md` contract to enforce architectural boundaries and purity rules.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/"
    loc:
      - "dir"
    note: "Directory exists but lacks AGENTS.md file."
