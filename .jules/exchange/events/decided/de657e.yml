title: "Test harness duplicates domain path logic"
statement: |
  The `TestContext` test harness contains hardcoded string paths that duplicate logic defined in the domain layer (e.g., `src/domain/paths.rs`). This increases maintenance burden and risks drift where tests pass against a different structure than the production code expects.
evidence:
  - path: "tests/harness/test_context.rs"
    loc:
      - "142"
    note: "Hardcoded path joins like .join(\"narrator\") duplicate domain logic."
