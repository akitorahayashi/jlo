title: "Critical CLI Upgrade Logic Lacks Integration Tests"
statement: |
  The `cli_upgrade::execute` function relies on brittle external command execution (`git ls-remote`, `cargo install`) without integration tests or mocks, creating a high risk of broken upgrades if external behaviors change or errors occur.
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/cli_upgrade.rs"
    loc:
      - "54-86"
    note: "Core upgrade logic executes external commands without test harness verification."
