title: "Hardcoded Multi-Role Layers in Manifest Logic"
statement: |
  The `is_default_role_file` function in `src/domain/workstations/manifest.rs` hardcodes the layer names "observers" and "innovators" to identify role files. This creates a hidden coupling that will break if new multi-role layers are added.
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/workstations/manifest.rs"
    loc: ["67-68"]
    note: "Explicitly matches 'observers' and 'innovators'."
