title: "Inconsistent Layer Naming (Singular vs Plural)"
statement: |
  The codebase exhibits inconsistent naming for layers, mixing singular and plural forms.
  Specifically, `Layer::Observers` and `Layer::Innovators` are plural in the enum definition, directory structure (`observers`, `innovators`), and prompt templates (`observers_prompt.j2`).
  However, `Layer::display_name` returns singular forms ("Observer", "Innovator"), and `Layer::from_dir_name` accepts both.
  This creates confusion in user-facing CLI output and documentation, where terms might be used interchangeably without clear rationale.

evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/workspace/layer.rs"
    loc:
      - "pub enum Layer"
    note: "Enum variants Observers and Innovators are plural."
  - path: "src/domain/workspace/layer.rs"
    loc:
      - "fn display_name"
    note: "Returns singular 'Observer' and 'Innovator' for plural enum variants."
  - path: "src/domain/workspace/layer.rs"
    loc:
      - "fn dir_name"
    note: "Returns plural 'observers' and 'innovators' directory names."
