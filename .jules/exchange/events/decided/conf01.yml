title: "Configuration Parsing Logic Coupled to Command Layer"
statement: |
  The `init` command directly implements TOML parsing and DTO definition for workflow configuration, creating a tight coupling between the CLI command and the configuration persistence format. This violates 'Boundary Sovereignty' by leaking persistence details into the application layer.

evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/init.rs"
    loc:
      - "struct WorkflowGenerateConfigDto"
      - "fn load_workflow_generate_config"
    note: "DTOs and parsing logic defined within the command module."
