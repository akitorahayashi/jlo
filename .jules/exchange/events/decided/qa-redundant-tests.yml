title: "Redundant coverage in CLI integration tests"
statement: |
  Both `tests/cli_commands.rs` and `tests/api_coverage.rs` extensively test the same initialization, bootstrapping, and structure verification flows.
  Specifically, `init_creates_jules_directory` and `test_api_coverage_full_flow` perform nearly identical setup and assertion steps, increasing test suite runtime without adding unique value.
evidence:
  - path: "tests/cli_commands.rs"
    loc:
      - "fn init_creates_jules_directory"
    note: "Tests init, bootstrap, structure verification in detail."
  - path: "tests/api_coverage.rs"
    loc:
      - "fn test_api_coverage_full_flow"
    note: "Tests init, bootstrap, structure verification in detail."
