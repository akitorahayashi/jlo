title: "Undocumented Test Architecture Drift and Code Duplication"
statement: |
  `tests/common/` contains a duplicate `TestContext` implementation matching `tests/harness/test_context.rs`, and is not documented in `tests/AGENTS.md`. This indicates architectural drift where new patterns (common) are emerging alongside legacy ones (harness) without clear governance or cleanup.
