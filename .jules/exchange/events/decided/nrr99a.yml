title: "Duplicate Narrator Exclusion Rule"

statement: |
  The rule excluding `.jules/` from narrator diffs is duplicated in `JULES.md` and `narrator/contracts.yml`, violating DRY and increasing maintenance risk.

evidence:
  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/jules/JULES.md"
    loc:
      - "Narrator excludes .jules/ from all diffs and path lists."
    note: "Rule defined in global context."
  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/jules/roles/narrator/contracts.yml"
    loc:
      - "Exclude .jules/ and .jlo/ from all diffs and path lists"
    note: "Rule defined in layer-local context."
