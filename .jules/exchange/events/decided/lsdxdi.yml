title: "Inaccurate `jlo workflow exchange` Command Structure"
statement: |
  The `README.md` documents `jlo workflow exchange` commands as subcommands (e.g., `inspect`, `publish-proposals`), but the implementation flattens them into `workflow` subcommands (e.g., `inspect-exchange`, `publish-proposals`, `clean-requirement`, `clean-mock`).
evidence:
  - path: "README.md"
    loc:
      - "jlo workflow exchange inspect"
      - "jlo workflow exchange publish-proposals"
    note: "Documents `exchange` as a distinct subcommand group."
  - path: "src/app/cli/workflow/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "enum WorkflowCommands"
      - "InspectExchange"
      - "PublishProposals"
    note: "Defines flattened commands like `InspectExchange` directly under `WorkflowCommands`."
