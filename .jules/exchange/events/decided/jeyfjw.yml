title: "Implicit Data Models for Exchange Artifacts"
statement: |
  Core domain entities like Proposals and Perspectives lack canonical domain models in `src/domain/`. Instead, they are defined as ad-hoc, private structs within application command handlers (e.g., `ProposalData`, `PerspectiveData` in `src/app/commands/workflow/exchange/publish_proposals.rs`) or treated as raw file paths. This leads to scattered validation logic and makes the domain model difficult to understand and evolve. It violates "Boundary Sovereignty" as the application layer effectively owns the data definitions.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/workflow/exchange/publish_proposals.rs"
    loc:
      - "35-65"
    note: "Defines private `ProposalData` and `PerspectiveData` structs."
  - path: "src/domain/exchange/proposals/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "1"
    note: "Contains no struct definitions, only module exports."
  - path: "src/domain/workstations/mod.rs"

    note: "Contains no struct definitions, only module exports."
