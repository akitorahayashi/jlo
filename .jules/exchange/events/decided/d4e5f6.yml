title: "Lack of Unit Tests for Domain Logic"

statement: |
  Core domain logic in `src/domain/` (e.g., requirement processing) appears to lack dedicated unit tests, relying on broader integration tests.

evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/requirement.rs"
    loc:
      - "struct RequirementHeader"
    note: "Domain logic without inline tests."
  - path: "tests/"
    loc:
      - "dir"
    note: "No unit tests found for domain logic in tests/ directory."
