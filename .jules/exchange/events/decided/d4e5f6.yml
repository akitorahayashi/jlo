title: "Configuration domain logic leaks into adapters"
statement: |
  The domain model for configuration (e.g. WorkflowGenerateConfig) is anemic, acting only as a data container. The business logic for validation and structure enforcement (e.g. cron string validation) resides in the adapter layer (src/adapters/control_plane_config.rs), violating the principle that domain logic should be encapsulated within the domain.
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/config/workflow_generate.rs"
    loc: ["6", "16"]
    note: "WorkflowGenerateConfig is an anemic data struct without validation logic"
  - path: "src/adapters/control_plane_config.rs"
    loc: ["50", "70"]
    note: "Adapter performs manual validation of domain concepts (cron format, required fields)"
