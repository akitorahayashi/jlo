title: "Sparse jlo run Integration Tests (Execution Untested)"
statement: |
  The `jlo run` command is tested primarily for `prompt-preview` and error handling.
  There are no integration tests that verify actual execution (non-preview), leaving the core agent loop and side-effects (file creation, git operations) vulnerable.
evidence:
  - path: "tests/cli/run/mod.rs"
    loc: ["1"]
    note: "Test listing shows only prompt-preview and error contracts."
  - path: "src/app/cli/run.rs"
    loc: ["1"]
    note: "Command logic contains full execution path not covered by tests."
