title: "Unverified Workflow Generation Source-of-Truth"
statement: |
  CI generates workflows to a temp directory and lints them, but never verifies that the committed workflows match the generated output. This allows drift between the generator templates and the runtime workflows.
evidence:
  - path: ".github/workflows/run-linters.yml"
    loc:
      - "37-47"
    note: "Generates to .tmp/ and lints .tmp/, but no diff check against .github/workflows/"
