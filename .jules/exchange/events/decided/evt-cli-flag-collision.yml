# Content
title: "CLI Flag Collision: `-r` Overloaded"
statement: |
  The `-r` flag is inconsistently overloaded in the CLI. For `observers` and `innovators`, it stands for `--role`. For `planner` and `implementer`, it stands for `--requirement`. This creates confusion and violates the principle of consistent user-facing vocabulary.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/cli/run.rs"
    loc:
      - "24-25"
    note: "Observers uses `-r` for `role`"
  - path: "src/app/cli/run.rs"
    loc:
      - "53-54"
    note: "Planner uses `-r` for `requirement`"
