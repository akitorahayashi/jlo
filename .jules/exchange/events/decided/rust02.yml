title: "Duplicated Test Doubles & DRY Violation"
statement: |
  The `jlo run` command implementation in `src/app/commands/run/mod.rs` defines local `TestGit` and `TestGitHub` structs, duplicating the shared test doubles available in `src/testing/ports/`. This violates DRY, creates maintenance debt, and leads to inconsistent test behavior.
