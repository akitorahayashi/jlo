title: Missing Unit Tests for Path Logic in Exchange Events
statement: |
  The `src/domain/exchange/events/paths.rs` module contains path manipulation logic (`events_dir`, `events_state_dir`, etc.) but lacks unit tests. This increases the risk of subtle bugs in path handling and regressions during future changes.
evidence:
  - path: src/domain/exchange/events/paths.rs
    loc: ["1-23"]
    note: entire file lacks unit tests
