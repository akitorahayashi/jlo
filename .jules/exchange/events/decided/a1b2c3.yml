title: "Volatile Content Duplication and Drift in Scaffold AGENTS.md"
statement: |
  `src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md` duplicates the "Prompt Hierarchy" section from `AGENTS.md` with wording variance, and contains a stale list of schema files (e.g. `issue.yml` vs `requirements.yml`), violating the "Duplicated directives" and "Volatile implementation detail" anti-patterns.
evidence:
  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "Prompt Hierarchy table"
    note: "Duplicates prompt hierarchy definition from root AGENTS.md"
  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "Schema Files table"
    note: "Lists `issue.yml` which does not exist in .jules/roles/decider/schemas/"
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "Prompt Hierarchy (No Duplication)"
    note: "Authoritative definition of prompt hierarchy"
  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/jules/roles/decider/schemas/requirements.yml"
    loc:
      - "file exists"
    note: "Actual schema file name differs from documentation"
