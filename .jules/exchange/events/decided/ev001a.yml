title: "Inconsistent Role Identifier in Workstation Perspective"
statement: |
  The `Layer::perspective_role_key` implementation uses `observer` for the Observers layer and `role` for the Innovators layer to identify the specific role in the perspective file.
  The target architectural concept is "Role", and both layers are multi-role. Using inconsistent keys creates unnecessary complexity and violates the "One Concept, One Preferred Term" principle.

# Evidence supporting the observation

  - path: "src/domain/layers/mod.rs"

      - "163"
    note: "Layer::perspective_role_key returns different keys for Innovators ('role') and Observers ('observer')."
