title: "High-Entropy Filenames in Top-Level Docs Directory"
statement: |
  The `docs/` directory contains highly specific operational maps (`WORKFLOW_BRANCH_IMPACT_MAP.md`, `WORKFLOW_LAYER_CHANGE_MAP.md`) alongside high-level guides (`CONTROL_PLANE_OWNERSHIP.md`). This flat accumulation increases navigation cost and mixes architectural concepts with operational reference details.
evidence:
  - path: "docs/"
    loc: ["WORKFLOW_BRANCH_IMPACT_MAP.md", "WORKFLOW_LAYER_CHANGE_MAP.md"]
    note: "File listing shows mix of high-level architecture and low-level maps."
