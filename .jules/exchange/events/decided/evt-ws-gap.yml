title: "Workstream Concept Missing in Codebase"
statement: |
  The term 'workstream' is referenced in documentation and memory but is completely absent from the codebase, creating a significant mental model mismatch and potential findability issue for developers expecting this structure.

evidence:
  - path: ".jules"
    loc: ["ls output"]
    note: "The '.jules' directory contains 'workstations' but not 'workstreams'."
  - path: "."
    loc: ["grep -r workstream ."]
    note: "Zero occurrences of 'workstream' in the entire repository."
