title: "Missing `jlo add` command in `src/AGENTS.md`"
statement: |
  The `src/AGENTS.md` file, which claims to be the SSOT for verification, omits the `jlo add` command in its CLI Commands table, despite it being a core command for installing built-in roles.
evidence:
  - path: "src/AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "CLI Commands"
    note: "Table lists `create` but omits `add`."
  - path: "src/app/cli/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "Commands::Add"
    note: "Implementation of `jlo add`."
