title: "Inconsistent Command Module Structure"
statement: |
  The `src/app/commands/` directory contains a mix of files and subdirectories.
  Some commands (`init`, `update`) are files, while others (`run`, `add`) are directories.
  This inconsistency reduces findability and makes it harder to locate command logic.

evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/"
    loc:
      - "cli_upgrade.rs"
      - "deinit.rs"
      - "init.rs"
      - "run/"
      - "add/"
    note: "Sibling entries showing mixed file/directory structure for commands."
