title: "Monolithic AppError Violates Boundary Sovereignty"
statement: |
  The `AppError` enum in `src/domain/error.rs` is a single monolithic type that handles
  infrastructure, configuration, and domain errors. This leaks transport details (e.g., GitError)
  into core domain logic, violating Boundary Sovereignty.
confidence: "high"
issue_id: "j3k72l"
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/error.rs"
    loc: ["pub enum AppError {"]
    note: "Monolithic enum mixing distinct concerns."
  - path: "src/domain/error.rs"
    loc: ["GitError { command: String, details: String },"]
    note: "Transport detail (Git command) leaked into domain error."
  - path: "src/domain/error.rs"
    loc: ["TomlParseError(String),"]
    note: "Serialization detail leaked into domain error."
rationale: |
  A single error type for the entire application couples unrelated modules and makes error handling brittle.
  Domain logic should not be aware of specific transport failures like Git command strings or TOML parsing issues.
  Decomposing this into domain-specific errors (e.g., `WorkspaceError`, `ConfigError`, `VcsError`) would improve maintainability.
