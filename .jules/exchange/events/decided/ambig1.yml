title: "Overloaded 'Role' Terminology"
statement: |
  The term "Role" is overloaded to refer to both the architectural layer (e.g., Narrator) and specific personas within a layer (e.g., Observer roles). This ambiguity is reinforced by directory structures where layers are nested under `.jules/roles/` but some layers contain further roles.

evidence:
  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md"
    loc: ["Scaffold Mapping"]
    note: "Documentation states 'layers -> roles' mapping, conflating the two concepts."
  - path: "src/domain/workspace/layer.rs"
    loc: ["Layer::is_single_role"]
    note: "Code explicitly handles 'single-role' layers, acknowledging the conceptual overlap."
