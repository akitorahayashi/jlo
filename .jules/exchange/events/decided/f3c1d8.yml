# Content
title: "Unindexed Developer Context in Central Map"
statement: |
  Critical developer documentation files located within source directories (e.g., `src/AGENTS.md`, `.github/AGENTS.md`) are not referenced in the central documentation index (`docs/README.md`). They are currently only reachable via the root `AGENTS.md`, which creates a split-brain discovery problem where operational docs are in `docs/` and dev docs are hidden in `src/` without a unifying map.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "docs/README.md"
    loc:
      - "1"
    note: "Lists architecture/ and operations/ but omits src/AGENTS.md"
  - path: "src/AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "1"
    note: "Contains essential CLI development context not indexed centrally"
