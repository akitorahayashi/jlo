# Content
title: "Overloaded `jlo update` Command"
statement: |
  The `jlo update` command is overloaded, handling both control-plane updates (`update.rs`) and CLI binary upgrades (`cli_upgrade.rs`). This violates the principle of unambiguous precedence and explicit ownership boundaries.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/cli/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "Line 131"
    note: "`run_update` dispatches to both `api::update_cli` and `api::update` based on flags."
