title: "Domain Logic Lacks Property-Based Verification"
statement: |
  The repository relies exclusively on example-based testing for domain logic and configuration parsing. Complex state spaces in configuration validation and domain modeling are not exhaustively covered, leaving potential edge cases unverified. Introducing property-based testing (e.g., `proptest`) would improve coverage and robustness by automatically exploring input variations.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/domain/layers/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "mod tests"
    note: "Unit tests use fixed inputs."
  - path: "tests/cli/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "mod cli_contracts"
    note: "Integration tests use specific scenarios."
