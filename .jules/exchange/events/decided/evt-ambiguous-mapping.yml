# Content
title: "Ambiguous Scaffold Mapping in Documentation"
statement: |
  `src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md` documents `.jules/roles` as the structure but the adjacent source directory is `jules/layers`. The mapping logic is hidden in `scaffold_assets.rs`. This violates "No Ambiguous Priority" and "Execution-critical completeness" for maintainers.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "1-50"
    note: "Documents .jules/roles structure but resides near jules/layers."
  - path: "src/adapters/assets/scaffold_assets.rs"
    loc:
      - "62-72"
    note: "Contains the unmap_scaffold_path logic that maps layers to roles."
