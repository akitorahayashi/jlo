title: "Ambiguous 'Agent' vs 'Role' Terminology"
statement: |
  The term "Agent" is used inconsistently in documentation and comments, often interchangeably with "Role" or "Role Execution", but is not defined as a distinct concept in the domain model. This creates confusion about whether "Agent" implies a separate entity or just a runtime instance of a Role.
