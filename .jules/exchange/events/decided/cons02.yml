title: "jlo run Requirement Path Drift"
statement: |
  The documentation for `jlo run` implies that the requirement path is a positional argument (e.g., `jlo run planner .jules/exchange/requirements/...`), but the implementation requires the `--requirement` (or `-r`) flag.

# Evidence supporting the observation
evidence:
  - path: "README.md"
    loc:
      - "jlo run planner .jules/exchange/requirements/auth-inconsistency.yml"
    note: "Documentation shows positional argument usage."
  - path: "src/app/cli/run.rs"
    loc:
      - "#[arg(long, short = 'r')]"
      - "requirement: PathBuf"
    note: "The `requirement` argument is defined with `#[arg(long, short = 'r')]`, making it a flag."
