  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/jules/JULES.md"
    loc:
      - "Narrator: jules-narrator-<id>"
    note: "Branch prefix defined globally."
  - path: "src/assets/scaffold/jules/roles/narrator/contracts.yml"
    loc:
      - "branch_prefix: jules-narrator-"
    note: "Branch prefix defined locally."
