# Content
title: "Documentation inconsistencies regarding workflows, actions, and roles"
statement: |
  There are inconsistencies between the documentation (README.md, AGENTS.md) and the codebase state.
  1. README.md omits several GitHub Actions workflows present in .github/workflows/.
  2. README.md omits local actions present in .github/actions/.
  3. AGENTS.md omits the 'consistency' observer from the built-in roles list.

evidence:
  - path: "README.md"
    loc: "GitHub Actions Workflows table"
    note: "Lists only 6 workflows, but .github/workflows/ contains 12."
  - path: ".github/workflows/"
    loc: "/"
    note: "Contains build.yml, ci-workflows.yml, run-linters.yml, etc. not in README."
  - path: "README.md"
    loc: "GitHub Actions Workflows table"
    note: "Does not list jules-invoke and setup actions."
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc: "Built-in Roles table"
    note: "Does not list the 'consistency' observer role."
  - path: ".jules/roles/observers/consistency/"
    loc: "/"
    note: "The consistency role exists in the codebase."
