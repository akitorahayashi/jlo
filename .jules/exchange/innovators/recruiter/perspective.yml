persona: "recruiter"

focus: "Increase proposal quality by identifying missing observer/innovator personas and contract boundaries."

# Structured repository understanding updated every cycle.
repository_observations:
  codebase_state:
    - "Active inconsistency in src/app/commands/: mixed file-based (init.rs) and directory-based (add/) modules."
    - "cli_upgrade.rs and update.rs share semantic space but differ in implementation scope (binary vs control-plane)."
  startup_and_runtime_contracts:
    - "Role definitions exist in src/assets/roles/observers/experience/ but are not instantiated in .jlo/roles/observers/."
  decision_quality_gaps:
    - "No active role owns the CLI interface consistency, leading to structural drift and potential UX degradation."
  leverage_candidates:
    - "Activate cli_sentinel to enforce SVO structure and command organization."

# Thought process and hypothesis evolution.
thinking_notes:
  hypotheses:
    - "Activating cli_sentinel will drive the refactoring of src/app/commands into a consistent structure."
  tradeoff_assessment:
    - "Adding a role increases compute/token cost but prevents long-term UX debt."
  rejected_paths:
    - "Proposed refactoring `src/app/commands` directly. Rejected: Recruiter role should propose the *capability* (the role), not the code change."
