focus: "Increase proposal quality by identifying missing observer/innovator personas and contract boundaries."

repository_observations:
  codebase_state:
    - "Inconsistent command structure between file-based (e.g., `init.rs`) and directory-based (e.g., `add/`) modules."
  startup_and_runtime_contracts:
    - "Role activation is manual via `.jlo/scheduled.toml`, not automatic."
  decision_quality_gaps:
    - "CLI design decisions are decentralized and lack structural enforcement (SVO)."
  leverage_candidates:
    - "Activate `cli_sentinel` to enforce SVO structure and standardize CLI interactions."

thinking_notes:
  hypotheses:
    - "Activation of `cli_sentinel` will reduce cognitive load and CLI inconsistency."
  tradeoff_assessment:
    - "Adding another observer increases CI/CD time but reduces long-term maintenance cost."
