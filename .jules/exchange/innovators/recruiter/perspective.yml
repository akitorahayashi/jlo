persona: "recruiter"

focus: "Identify missing roles and contract boundaries."

repository_observations:
  codebase_state:
    - "jlo is a CLI tool whose primary product is its command-line interface."
    - "The CLI command structure is growing in complexity (e.g. `workflow workspace clean mock`)."
  startup_and_runtime_contracts:
    - "Role definitions exist in `src/assets/roles/` but are not all active in `.jlo/roles/`."
  decision_quality_gaps:
    - "No automated observer is currently responsible for validating CLI UX consistency or SVO adherence."
  leverage_candidates:
    - "Activating `cli_sentinel` to audit new commands before they are merged."

thinking_notes:
  hypotheses:
    - "Introducing `cli_sentinel` will prevent UX degradation as the CLI surface area expands."
  tradeoff_assessment:
    - "Adding another observer increases token cost but prevents long-term UX debt in the primary interface."
  rejected_paths:
    - "Merging CLI checks into `tactician` (incorrect scope; tactician owns `AGENTS.md` contracts)."
