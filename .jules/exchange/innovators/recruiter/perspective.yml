persona: "recruiter"

focus: "Identify missing roles and contract boundaries."

repository_observations:
  codebase_state:
    - "jlo is a CLI tool whose primary product is its command-line interface."
    - "The CLI command structure is growing in complexity (e.g. `workflow workspace clean mock`)."
  startup_and_runtime_contracts:
    - "Role definitions exist in `src/assets/roles/` but are not all active in `.jlo/roles/`."
    - "Contract definitions (e.g. `.jlo/roles/observers/contracts.yml`) appear to be missing."
  decision_quality_gaps:
    - "No automated observer is currently responsible for validating CLI UX consistency or SVO adherence."
  leverage_candidates:
    - "Activating `cli_sentinel` to audit new commands before they are merged."

thinking_notes:
  hypotheses:
    - "Introducing `cli_sentinel` will prevent UX degradation as the CLI surface area expands."
  tradeoff_assessment:
    - "Adding another observer increases token cost but prevents long-term UX debt in the primary interface."
  rejected_paths:
    - "Merging CLI checks into `tactician` (incorrect scope; tactician owns `AGENTS.md` contracts)."
    - "Renaming `cli_sentinel` to functional name (e.g., `ux_consistency`) - rejected to maintain alignment with source asset `cli_sentinel`."

feedback_assimilation:
  observer_inputs:
    - from: "tactician"
      signal: "Ensure role execution focuses on changes/diffs."
      impact_on_direction: "Explicitly prioritized auditing *changes* in proposal introduction and risk mitigation."
    - from: "librarian"
      signal: "Create docs/CLI_DESIGN_GUIDE.md as source of truth."
      impact_on_direction: "Added creation of design guide to proposal impact surface."
    - from: "qa"
      signal: "ObserversLayer lacks unit tests."
      impact_on_direction: "Added ObserversLayer testing to implementation cost and impact surface."
    - from: "taxonomy"
      signal: "Role name 'sentinel' inconsistent with functional naming."
      impact_on_direction: "Documented naming deviation in risks but retained `cli_sentinel` for asset consistency."
  next_focus:
    - "Investigate `devops` role for CI/CD pipeline integrity."

recent_proposals:
  - "Activate cli_sentinel observer for CLI UX consistency"
