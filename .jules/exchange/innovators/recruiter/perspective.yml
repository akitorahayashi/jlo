focus: "Identify missing roles and contract boundaries."

# Structured repository understanding updated every cycle.
repository_observations:
  codebase_state:
    - "The codebase is predominantly Rust, but the active observer set lacks a dedicated Rust language expert."
  startup_and_runtime_contracts:
    - "Roles are loaded from .jlo/roles/, but the authoritative source for roles is src/assets/roles/."
  decision_quality_gaps:
    - "Current code reviews lack expert scrutiny on ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, and error handling patterns specific to Rust."
  leverage_candidates:
    - "Activate the `rustacean` observer role from src/assets/roles/observers/language/rustacean/role.yml."

# Thought process and hypothesis evolution.
thinking_notes:
  hypotheses:
    - "Activating the rustacean observer will reduce memory safety risks and improve idiomatic Rust usage by catching issues early."
  tradeoff_assessment:
    - "Adding another observer increases the review loop complexity slightly but significantly reduces technical debt accumulation in core domain logic."
  rejected_paths:
    - "Proposing a generic 'code reviewer' role (rejected: specific expertise is needed for Rust)."

# Observer feedback assimilation and next-cycle planning.
