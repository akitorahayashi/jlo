focus: "Increase proposal quality by identifying missing observer/innovator personas and contract boundaries."

# Structured repository understanding updated every cycle.
repository_observations:
  codebase_state:
    - "Role definitions exist in `.jlo/roles/` and `src/assets/roles/` but not in `.jules/roles/` as expected by `recruiter` analysis points."
    - "The `rustacean` observer is defined in `src/assets/roles/observers/language/rustacean/role.yml` but is not instantiated in `.jlo/roles/observers/`."
    - "Unsafe blocks exist in `src/domain/configuration/loader.rs` (tests) and `src/app/commands/workflow/output.rs` (tests), without dedicated safety monitoring."
    - "`Arc<Mutex<T>>` is used in `src/domain/prompt_assembly/engine.rs`, a pattern the `rustacean` role specifically advises against as a default."
  startup_and_runtime_contracts:
    - "`src/domain/configuration/loader.rs` confirms `.jlo/` is used for runtime configuration."
    - "`AGENTS.md` states user configuration is in `.jlo/` and system definitions in `.jules/`."
  decision_quality_gaps:
    - "The `recruiter` role is currently unable to fulfill its mandate due to incorrect file path references in its own definition."
    - "Lack of a `rustacean` observer leaves `unsafe` code and complex ownership patterns unmonitored."
  leverage_candidates:
    - "Updating role definitions to point to the correct `.jlo/roles` or `src/assets/roles` paths will enable accurate gap analysis."
    - "Instantiating the `rustacean` observer will provide immediate oversight for safety-critical code."

# Thought process and hypothesis evolution.
thinking_notes:
  hypotheses:
    - "Fixing the path references in `recruiter` role definition will allow it to correctly identify missing roles."
    - "Hiring the `rustacean` observer will reduce the risk of undefined behavior and concurrency bugs."
  tradeoff_assessment:
    - "Pointing to `.jlo/roles` analyzes the deployed instance; pointing to `src/assets/roles` analyzes the source of truth. Since `recruiter` suggests new roles, looking at `src/assets` might be more appropriate to avoid suggesting already-existing-but-undeployed roles, but `.jlo` shows what is active."
    - "Adding `rustacean` increases the observer workload but provides critical safety guarantees for a system managing file operations and unsafe blocks."
  rejected_paths:
    - "Moving role definitions to `.jules/` was rejected as `.jlo/` is the established pattern for instance configuration."

# Observer feedback assimilation and next-cycle planning.
feedback_assimilation:
  observer_inputs:
    - "Consistency confirmed drift between documented architecture and recruiter instructions."
    - "QA verified incorrect path references and suggested a schema validation test."
    - "Structural Arch confirmed .jlo/roles/ is the correct location for instances."
  next_focus:
    - "Verify if other roles have similar path reference issues."
    - "Monitor the effectiveness of the `rustacean` role once hired."
