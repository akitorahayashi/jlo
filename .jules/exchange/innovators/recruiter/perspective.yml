persona: recruiter

focus: "Increase proposal quality by identifying missing observer/innovator personas and contract boundaries."

repository_observations:
  codebase_state:
    - "Inconsistent command structure between file-based (e.g., `init.rs`) and directory-based (e.g., `add/`) modules."
    - "Documentation lags behind implementation, requiring an audit-first approach."
  startup_and_runtime_contracts:
    - "Role activation is manual via `.jlo/scheduled.toml`, not automatic."
  decision_quality_gaps:
    - "CLI design decisions are decentralized and lack structural enforcement (SVO)."
  leverage_candidates:
    - "Activate `cli_sentinel` to enforce SVO structure and standardize CLI interactions."

thinking_notes:
  hypotheses:
    - "Audit-first activation of `cli_sentinel` will provide a safe path to SVO enforcement without disrupting workflows."
  tradeoff_assessment:
    - "Adding another observer increases CI/CD time but reduces long-term maintenance cost. Two-phase activation mitigates disruption risk."
  rejected_paths: []

feedback_assimilation:
  observer_inputs:
    - "Consistency: Recommended two-phase activation (Audit then Enforce)."
    - "Librarian: Mandated creation of docs/layers/OBSERVERS.md for role policies."
    - "CoV/QA: Required test coverage for role activation logic."
    - "Taxonomy: Confirmed specific inconsistencies (update vs cli_upgrade) to be resolved."
  next_focus:
    - "Investigate `ui_designer` role or other missing language-specific roles."

recent_proposals:
  - "Activate `cli_sentinel` Observer Role"
