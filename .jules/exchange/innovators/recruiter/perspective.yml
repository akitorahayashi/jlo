persona: "recruiter"

focus: "Increase proposal quality by identifying missing observer/innovator personas and contract boundaries."

# Structured repository understanding updated every cycle.
repository_observations:
  codebase_state:
    - "Active inconsistency in src/app/commands/: mixed file-based (init.rs) and directory-based (add/) modules."
    - "cli_upgrade.rs and update.rs share semantic space but differ in implementation scope (binary vs control-plane)."
  startup_and_runtime_contracts:
    - "Role definitions exist in src/assets/roles/observers/experience/ but are not instantiated in .jlo/roles/observers/."
  decision_quality_gaps:
    - "No active role owns the CLI interface consistency, leading to structural drift and potential UX degradation."
  leverage_candidates:
    - "Activate cli_sentinel to enforce SVO structure and command organization."

# Thought process and hypothesis evolution.
thinking_notes:
  hypotheses:
    - "Activating cli_sentinel will drive the refactoring of src/app/commands into a consistent structure."
    - "Observers require robust testing infrastructure to prevent regression."
  tradeoff_assessment:
    - "Adding a role increases compute/token cost but prevents long-term UX debt."
    - "Implementation cost is increased by the need for new tests and documentation, but this ensures stability."
  rejected_paths:
    - "Proposed refactoring `src/app/commands` directly. Rejected: Recruiter role should propose the *capability* (the role), not the code change."

# Observer feedback assimilation and next-cycle planning.
feedback_assimilation:
  observer_inputs:
    - "Consistency: Confirmed structural inconsistency and update/upgrade ambiguity."
    - "Cov: Flagged lack of tests in observer runner (src/app/commands/run/layer/observers.rs)."
    - "Data Arch: Confirmed correlation between command structure and data model fragmentation."
    - "Librarian: Requested documentation in docs/layers/OBSERVERS.md."
    - "QA: Requested unit and integration tests for the new observer."
    - "Rustacean: Suggested checking for macro bloat and argument types."
    - "Structural Arch: Strongly supported activation."
    - "Tactician: Required explicit scheduling in .jlo/scheduled.toml."
    - "Taxonomy: Suggested standardizing command terms."
  next_focus:
    - "Investigate potential gaps in the 'innovators' layer."
