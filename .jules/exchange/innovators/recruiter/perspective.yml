focus: "Increase proposal quality by identifying missing observer/innovator personas and contract boundaries."

# Structured repository understanding updated every cycle.
repository_observations:
  codebase_state:
    - "Role definitions exist in `.jlo/roles/` and `src/assets/roles/` but not in `.jules/roles/` as expected by `recruiter` analysis points."
  startup_and_runtime_contracts:
    - "`src/domain/configuration/loader.rs` confirms `.jlo/` is used for runtime configuration."
    - "`AGENTS.md` states user configuration is in `.jlo/` and system definitions in `.jules/`."
  decision_quality_gaps:
    - "The `recruiter` role is currently unable to fulfill its mandate due to incorrect file path references in its own definition."
  leverage_candidates:
    - "Updating role definitions to point to the correct `.jlo/roles` or `src/assets/roles` paths will enable accurate gap analysis."

# Thought process and hypothesis evolution.
thinking_notes:
  hypotheses:
    - "Fixing the path references in `recruiter` role definition will allow it to correctly identify missing roles."
  tradeoff_assessment:
    - "Pointing to `.jlo/roles` analyzes the deployed instance; pointing to `src/assets/roles` analyzes the source of truth. Since `recruiter` suggests new roles, looking at `src/assets` might be more appropriate to avoid suggesting already-existing-but-undeployed roles, but `.jlo` shows what is active."
  rejected_paths:
    - "Moving role definitions to `.jules/` was rejected as `.jlo/` is the established pattern for instance configuration."

# Observer feedback assimilation and next-cycle planning.
feedback_assimilation:
  observer_inputs:
    - "Consistency confirmed drift between documented architecture and recruiter instructions."
    - "QA verified incorrect path references and suggested a schema validation test."
    - "Structural Arch confirmed .jlo/roles/ is the correct location for instances."
  next_focus:
    - "Verify if other roles have similar path reference issues."
