title: "Update Recruiter Role Definition Paths"
problem: |
  The `recruiter` role is instructed to analyze role definitions in `.jules/roles/observers/*/role.yml` and `.jules/roles/innovators/*/role.yml`. However, repository inspection and `AGENTS.md` confirm that role instance definitions reside in `.jlo/roles/` (instances) and source definitions in `src/assets/roles/`. The `.jules/roles/` directory contains only system contracts and schemas, not `role.yml` files. This misdirection causes the recruiter to look in the wrong place for evidence, effectively disabling its primary function.
introduction: |
  Update the `recruiter` role definition (specifically `analysis_points` and `evidence_expectations`) to reference the correct `.jlo/roles/` directory for active role instances. This aligns the role's instructions with the actual system architecture, ensuring the agent inspects the deployed configuration rather than a non-existent location.
importance: |
  Critical. Without this fix, the `recruiter` role cannot perform its core function of identifying role gaps and boundary overlaps, leading to stagnation in team evolution and missed opportunities for better coordination.
impact_surface:
  - ".jlo/roles/innovators/recruiter/role.yml"
  - "src/assets/roles/innovators/recruiter/role.yml"
  - "tests/doctor/mock_fixture_validity_contract.rs"
implementation_cost: |
  Low. Requires only text updates to YAML files and adding a simple path validation test case.
consistency_risks:
  - "None. The change corrects a drift between documentation/intent and implementation."
verification_signals:
  - "Recruiter agent successfully reads role definitions from .jlo/roles/ during execution."
  - "jlo doctor or new test confirms role paths are valid."
