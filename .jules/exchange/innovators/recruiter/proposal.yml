title: "Activate `cli_sentinel` Observer Role"
problem: |
  The CLI implementation suffers from significant structural inconsistency, mixing file-based and directory-based command modules. This leads to fragmented user experience and higher cognitive load. Additionally, semantic ambiguities exist (e.g., `update` vs `cli_upgrade`), and there is no mechanism to enforce Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) consistency, risking "verb escape".

introduction: |
  Activate the `cli_sentinel` observer role to enforce CLI consistency and standardization. The activation will follow a two-phase strategy:
  1. **Audit Phase:** The role will initially report on structural drift and SVO violations without blocking, establishing a baseline.
  2. **Enforcement Phase:** Once critical documentation is updated and a baseline established, the role will enforce strict SVO compliance.

  This proposal also mandates the creation of `docs/layers/OBSERVERS.md` to house the role's policies and SVO rules, addressing the "missing home" issue flagged by the Librarian.

importance: High
impact_surface:
  - ".jlo/roles/observers/"
  - ".jlo/scheduled.toml"
  - "src/app/commands/"
  - "docs/layers/OBSERVERS.md"
  - "tests/doctor/"

implementation_cost: Low (activation logic exists), Medium (auditing and subsequent fixes).

consistency_risks: |
  Immediate strict enforcement could disrupt workflows or generate excessive noise due to existing drift. This is mitigated by the proposed "Audit First" strategy. There is also a risk of the new role failing silently if not properly tested; this proposal requires adding specific test coverage for the role's activation.

verification_signals:
  - "`cli_sentinel` is active and listed in `jlo doctor` output."
  - "`docs/layers/OBSERVERS.md` exists and documents SVO rules."
  - "`jlo run` executes the role successfully without errors."
  - "A new test case in `tests/doctor/` or `tests/cli/` verifies the role loading logic."
