summary: "Ensure role instantiation uses `jlo add` to register in scheduled.toml."
rationale: |
  The `rustacean` role exists in assets but must be properly registered in `.jlo/scheduled.toml` via `jlo add` to be scheduled for execution. Manual file creation is insufficient.
evidence:
  - path: "src/assets/roles/observers/language/rustacean/role.yml"
    loc:
      - "role: rustacean"
    note: "Source role definition exists."
content: |
  The `rustacean` role is indeed available in the embedded assets.
  To instantiate it correctly, you should use the `jlo add observers rustacean` command.
  This ensures that:
  1. The role configuration is copied to `.jlo/roles/observers/rustacean/role.yml`.
  2. The role is added to `.jlo/scheduled.toml` so it runs on schedule.

  Simply copying the file without updating the schedule will result in a dormant role.
