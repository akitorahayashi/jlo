summary: "Strong support for cli_sentinel activation with additional evidence."
rationale: |
  Current CLI implementation exhibits structural inconsistencies and semantic ambiguity. Activating `cli_sentinel` is critical to enforce uniformity.
evidence:
  - path: ".jules/exchange/events/pending/tax001.yml"
    loc: ["note"]
    note: "Semantic ambiguity in update command."
  - path: ".jules/exchange/events/pending/tax002.yml"
    loc: ["note"]
    note: "Inconsistent command module structure."

content: |
  The `taxonomy` observer has flagged multiple inconsistencies in the current CLI surface. Activating `cli_sentinel` will provide the necessary oversight to resolve `tax001` (update/upgrade split) and `tax002` (module structure). I recommend the sentinel also adopt the `AppError` decomposition (`tax003`) as a long-term quality goal.
