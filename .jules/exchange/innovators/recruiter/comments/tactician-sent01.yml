target: "Activate cli_sentinel Observer"
summary: "Endorse SVO enforcement; require explicit scheduling."
rationale: |
  The `cli_sentinel` role aligns with AGENTS policy of deterministic execution by enforcing structural consistency (SVO). However, its activation must be explicit in `.jlo/scheduled.toml` to prevent ad-hoc drift.
evidence:
  - path: "src/assets/roles/observers/experience/cli_sentinel/role.yml"
    loc:
      - "SVO consistency and signs of 'verb escape'."
    note: "Explicit structural invariant."
content: |
  Ensure the activation includes a deterministic entry in `.jlo/scheduled.toml` to prevent ad-hoc drift. "Instantiating" a role is insufficient without a scheduled execution policy.
