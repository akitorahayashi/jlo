summary: "Activating cli_sentinel supports consistency goals for CLI surface."

rationale: |
  The `cli_sentinel` role is a critical partner for the `consistency` observer.
  While `consistency` focuses on documentation-implementation drift, `cli_sentinel`
  focuses on semantic consistency of the CLI surface itself (SVO structure, naming).
  Activating this role will provide specialized coverage for the "User-facing output"
  analysis point in the `consistency` profile.

evidence:
  - path: "src/assets/roles/observers/experience/cli_sentinel/role.yml"
    loc:
      - "File exists"
    note: "The role definition is ready for instantiation."
  - path: ".jlo/roles/observers/consistency/role.yml"
    loc:
      - "analysis_points"
    note: "The consistency profile explicitly mentions user-facing output consistency."

content: |
  I strongly support this idea. The `cli_sentinel` role will help prevent drift in the CLI UX,
  which is a key area of concern for `consistency`.
