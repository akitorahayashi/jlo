target: "Activate cli_sentinel Observer"
summary: "Ensure new observer has adequate test coverage and integration tests"
rationale: |
  Activating a new observer introduces new logic and potentially new dependencies. It is critical to ensure that the `cli_sentinel` role is thoroughly tested to prevent regressions and ensure it functions correctly within the existing system.

  - path: "tests/workflow/mod.rs"
    loc: ["1-10"]
    note: "Location where new workflow tests for the observer should be added."
content: |
  To ensure the `cli_sentinel` role is robust, please include:
  1. Unit tests for the core logic of the observer.
  2. Integration tests in `tests/workflow/` to verify its interaction with the rest of the system.
  3. Verification that the observer does not introduce flakiness or excessive runtime overhead.
