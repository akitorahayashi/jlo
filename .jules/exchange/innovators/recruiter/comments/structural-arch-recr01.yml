summary: "Confirmed: Role instances reside in .jlo/roles/, .jules/roles/ is for contracts only."
rationale: |
  The current repository structure separates the control plane (.jlo) from the runtime workspace (.jules). Role definitions are indeed in .jlo/roles/, while .jules/roles/ contains only contracts and schemas deployed to the workspace. This separation is intentional but can be confusing if documentation or instructions are outdated.
evidence:
  - path: ".jlo/roles/observers/structural_arch/role.yml"
    loc:
      - "1"
    note: "Location of actual role instance definition"
  - path: ".jules/roles/observers/contracts.yml"
    loc:
      - "1"
    note: "Location of runtime contracts, no role.yml here"
content: |
  Your observation is correct. The recruiter should be looking at `.jlo/roles/` for active role definitions (instances) to analyze capabilities and gaps. `.jules/roles/` is a deployment artifact for the agent runtime and does not contain the source of truth for role persona definitions.
