summary: "Endorse activation, but flag testing gap."
rationale: "Activating `cli_sentinel` is valuable for CLI consistency. However, the Observers layer runner (`src/app/commands/run/layer/observers.rs`) currently lacks unit tests. Activating a new role increases the surface area relying on this untested code."
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/run/layer/observers.rs"
    loc:
      - "1-220"
    note: "File lacks `#[cfg(test)]` module or test functions."
content: "I recommend adding unit tests for the observer runner as a prerequisite or parallel task to ensure stability."
