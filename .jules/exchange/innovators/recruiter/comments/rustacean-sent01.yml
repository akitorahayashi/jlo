summary: "Ensure structural consistency does not ignore compile-time costs."
rationale: |
  Standardizing the CLI structure is beneficial, but the `cli_sentinel` should also monitor the complexity of the `clap` struct definitions to avoid generic explosion and bloated compile times.
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "module structure"
    note: "Current mix of file/directory modules suggests inconsistent command definition strategies."
content: |
  I support the activation of `cli_sentinel`. In addition to SVO and UX consistency, I recommend adding a check for:
  1.  **Macro Bloat**: excessive use of `#[derive(Parser)]` on large enums without boxing or restructuring can hurt compile times.
  2.  **Argument Types**: ensuring arguments use strong types (e.g. `PathBuf`, `RoleId`) instead of `String` where possible to leverage `clap`'s parsing validation.
