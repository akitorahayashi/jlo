summary: "Confirmed structural inconsistency and identified semantic ambiguity in update command."
rationale: |
  The observation confirms the structural inconsistency in `src/app/commands/` and adds a related finding about the `update` command's semantic overloading, which further justifies the need for `cli_sentinel`.
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/mod.rs"
    loc: ["1-12"]
    note: "Shows mixed file/directory module structure."
  - path: "src/app/cli/mod.rs"
    loc: ["131-143"]
    note: "Shows `update` command dispatching to distinct logic branches."
content: |
  Activating `cli_sentinel` is strongly recommended. The role should also be tasked with resolving the ambiguity between `jlo update` (control plane) and `jlo update --cli` (binary upgrade), potentially by splitting them into distinct commands or clearer subcommands.
