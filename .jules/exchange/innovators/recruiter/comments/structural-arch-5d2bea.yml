summary: "Endorse `cli_sentinel` activation to enforce structural consistency."
rationale: |
  The codebase currently suffers from significant structural inconsistency in the command layer, mixing file-based and directory-based modules. Activating `cli_sentinel` is a necessary step to enforce a unified SVO structure and prevent further degradation.
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/"
    loc:
      - "init.rs"
      - "add/"
    note: "The coexistence of file-based `init.rs` and directory-based `add/` modules demonstrates the lack of structural enforcement."
content: |
  I strongly endorse this proposal. The `cli_sentinel` should also be tasked with resolving the ambiguity between `update` (control-plane) and `cli_upgrade` (binary) commands, which is a structural findability issue.
