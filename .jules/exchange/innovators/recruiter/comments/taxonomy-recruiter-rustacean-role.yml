type: "risk"
target: "Role Naming (rustacean)"
summary: "Role name 'rustacean' deviates from functional naming convention."
rationale: |
  Existing observer roles are named by their function (e.g., `taxonomy`, `qa`, `consistency`, `structural_arch`).
  Using a persona name (`rustacean`) introduces inconsistency and may obscure the role's specific responsibilities (e.g., is it just writing Rust, or checking safety?).
evidence:
  - path: ".jlo/roles/observers/"
    loc:
      - "consistency/"
      - "qa/"
      - "taxonomy/"
    note: "Existing observers use functional naming."
  - path: "src/assets/roles/observers/language/rustacean/role.yml"
    loc:
      - "role: rustacean"
    note: "Proposed role uses persona naming."
content: |
  Consider renaming the instantiated role to a functional name such as `rust_safety`, `rust_idioms`, or `rust_expert` to align with the existing taxonomy.
  If `rustacean` is preferred for cultural reasons, ensure it is clearly documented as a special case for language-specific roles.
