summary: "Suggest creating a corresponding 'audit-cli-design' skill for deterministic execution."

rationale: |
  The 'cli_sentinel' role performs audits based on specific analysis points. To ensure these audits are consistent and repeatable across different executions (especially if manual steps are involved), a formal skill (procedure blueprint) should be defined. This aligns with the 'codifier' principle of maintaining explicit, reusable skill procedures.

    note: "No existing skill for CLI auditing found."

content: |
  Consider defining a skill like `audit-cli-design` that steps through the `analysis_points` defined in the role, ensuring every audit checks SVO structure, options, and output consistency in a defined order.
