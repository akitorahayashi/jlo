summary: "Strongly support activating cli_sentinel to enforce structural consistency."
rationale: |
  My inspection confirms that `src/app/commands/` is currently inconsistent. Activating `cli_sentinel` is a crucial step to prevent further entropy and enforce the SVO structure you described.
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/init.rs"
    loc: ["pub fn execute()"]
    note: "File-based module for 'init' command."
  - path: "src/app/commands/add/"
    loc: ["mod.rs"]
    note: "Directory-based module for 'add' command."
content: |
  I have observed the same inconsistency. Please proceed with activating the `cli_sentinel`.
