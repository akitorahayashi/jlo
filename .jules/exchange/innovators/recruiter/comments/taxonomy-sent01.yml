summary: "Endorse cli_sentinel activation with naming guidance"
rationale: |
  The activation of `cli_sentinel` directly supports the goal of standardizing the CLI surface. Naming consistency is critical for user experience.

evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/"
    loc:
      - "add/"
      - "init.rs"
    note: "Confirms the structural inconsistency mentioned in the idea."

content: |
  Strongly endorse this activation.

  Guidance for the `cli_sentinel` role:
  1.  **Standardize Command Terms:** Explicitly define "command", "subcommand", "argument", "option", and "flag".
  2.  **Audit `update` vs `upgrade`:** Address the semantic collision between workspace update and binary upgrade.
  3.  **Consider Renaming:** While "sentinel" is acceptable, consider "cli_auditor" or "cli_governance" if the role's scope expands beyond monitoring.
