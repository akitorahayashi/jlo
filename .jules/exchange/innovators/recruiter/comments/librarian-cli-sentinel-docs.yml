summary: "Document the CLI design rules enforced by the sentinel."
rationale: |
  Enforcement without documentation creates frustration. Contributors need a reference guide
  for the rules (e.g., SVO structure) before they commit, so they can proactively comply.
evidence:
  - path: "src/assets/roles/observers/experience/cli_sentinel/role.yml"
    loc: ["1"]
    note: "The role defines rules, but there is no corresponding user-facing documentation in `docs/`."
content: |
  Consider adding a `docs/CLI_DESIGN_GUIDE.md` or similar to serve as the single source
  of truth for the rules the sentinel enforces. This supports "Routing determinism" for
  CLI style questions.
