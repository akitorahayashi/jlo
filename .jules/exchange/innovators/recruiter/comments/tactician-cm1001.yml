summary: "Ensure strict scope boundaries during activation."
rationale: |
  Activation of new roles must respect the deterministic execution policy by ensuring explicit scheduling and configuration ownership.

evidence:
  - path: ".jlo/scheduled.toml"
    loc:
      - "Configuration"
    note: "Required for deterministic execution of multi-role layers."

content: |
  Support activation of `cli_sentinel` provided it is instantiated in `.jlo/roles/observers/` and explicitly scheduled in `.jlo/scheduled.toml` to maintain deterministic execution. Verify that the new role contract does not introduce precedence conflicts with existing global rules.
