summary: "Ensure Documentation Alignment for New Role"
rationale: |
  Activating a new observer role (`cli_sentinel`) introduces new constraints and feedback loops for developers. To maintain routing clarity, the responsibilities and authority of this role must be discoverable in the documentation architecture, not just in the `role.yml` source.
evidence:
  - path: "docs/layers/"
    loc: []
    note: "Current documentation lacks a dedicated section for Observers, making it difficult to index new roles like cli_sentinel."
content: |
  Consider updating `docs/layers/OBSERVERS.md` (or creating it) to detail the new role's mandate. This ensures developers understand why they are receiving new feedback (e.g., SVO warnings) without digging into source code.
