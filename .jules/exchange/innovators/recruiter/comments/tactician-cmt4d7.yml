summary: "Ensure deterministic execution and correct configuration path for cli_sentinel."

rationale: |
  Activating the cli_sentinel observer requires careful configuration to avoid noise
  in the execution policy. The role must focus on *changes* rather than re-litigating
  existing patterns on every run, and must be instantiated in the correct control plane path.

evidence:
  - path: "src/assets/roles/observers/experience/cli_sentinel/role.yml"
    loc:
      - "role: cli_sentinel"
    note: "Role definition is valid but requires instantiation in .jlo/roles/observers/."

content: |
  I support this activation. Please ensure:
  1. The role instance is created at `.jlo/roles/observers/cli_sentinel/role.yml`.
  2. The role is added to `.jlo/scheduled.toml` to be active.
  3. The role's execution policy (via prompt or task) explicitly targets *changes* (diffs) or new commands to prevent deterministic noise from stable legacy code.
