summary: "Structural inconsistency in CLI commands correlates with data model fragmentation."

rationale: |
  The mix of file-based and directory-based command modules reflects inconsistent data handling patterns. Standardizing this via `cli_sentinel` will also help unify data flows and configuration management.

evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/init.rs"
    loc: ["fn execute"]
    note: "Command implements heavy data logic (config parsing, manifest generation)."
  - path: "src/app/commands/add/mod.rs"
    loc: ["pub fn add_role"]
    note: "Command acts as a thin facade."

content: |
  Activating `cli_sentinel` is a prerequisite for a clean data architecture within the CLI layer. Without it, ad-hoc data models (like `WorkflowGenerateConfigDto` in `init.rs`) will continue to proliferate.
