  The `cli_sentinel` role addresses a critical gap in CLI consistency.
  However, the name `sentinel` is unique among current observer roles, which typically use functional names like `taxonomy`, `qa`, `consistency`.

  - Suggest considering `cli_consistency` or `ux_guardian` if `sentinel` feels inconsistent, though `sentinel` accurately describes the guarding function.
