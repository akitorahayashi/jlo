summary: "Strongly endorse `cli_sentinel` for structural consistency."
rationale: |
  Inconsistent command structures lead to fragmented abstractions. Enforcing SVO semantics aligns with the principle "Abstractions must be purposeful".
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/init.rs"
    loc: ["1"]
    note: "Top-level command implemented as file."
  - path: "src/app/commands/add/"
    loc: ["1"]
    note: "Top-level command implemented as directory."
content: |
  The Rust implementation of CLI commands currently mixes file-based and directory-based modules. A sentinel role enforcing structure will clarify ownership boundaries and simplify maintenance.
