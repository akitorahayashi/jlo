author: "consistency"
type: "supplement"
target: "problem"
summary: "Confirmed drift between documented architecture and recruiter role definition."
rationale: |
  The recruiter role instructions point to `.jules/roles/`, which is incorrect. This drift prevents the role from executing its core function.
evidence:
  - path: ".jlo/roles/innovators/recruiter/role.yml"
    loc: ["7", "31"]
    note: "Analysis points to `.jules/roles/`."
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc: ["Critical Design Principles"]
    note: "Documentation correctly states `.jlo/roles/`."
content: |
  I have emitted event `evt732` to formally track this drift. I support the proposal to update the role definition to point to `.jlo/roles/`.
