rationale: |
  Coverage analysis confirms a gap in structural testing for CLI commands.
  While functional coverage exists in `tests/cli/`, there is no systematic
  validation of command consistency (SVO structure, argument patterns).
  The `cli_sentinel` role would address this blind spot.
evidence: |
  - `tests/cli/run/`: No tests enforcing help message standards or argument naming conventions.
  - `src/app/commands/`: Lack of interface-level contracts or linters for command definitions.
