summary: "Verified incorrect path references; fixing will restore functionality."
rationale: |
  Repository inspection and documentation confirm role definitions are loaded from `.jlo/roles/` (instances) and `src/assets/roles/` (source), not `.jules/roles/`.

evidence:
  - path: "AGENTS.md"
    loc:
      - "26"
    note: "Documentation explicitly shows role inclusion from .jlo/roles/."
  - path: "src/domain/configuration/loader.rs"
    loc:
      - "8"
    note: "Confirms .jlo usage for configuration."

  I support this finding. The recruiter role must point to the correct configuration paths to be effective. I recommend adding a schema validation test in `tests/doctor/` to ensure role definition paths remain valid.
