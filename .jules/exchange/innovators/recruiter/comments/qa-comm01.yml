target: "Activate `cli_sentinel` Observer Role"
summary: "Ensure `cli_sentinel` includes self-verification tests."
rationale: |
  Introducing a new observer role without defining how it is tested risks adding untested logic to the system. The `cli_sentinel` must be verifiable.
evidence:
  - path: "src/assets/roles/observers/experience/"
    loc: ["cli_sentinel"]
    note: "Source directory for the role."
content: |
  Consider adding a test plan or ensuring the role's logic is covered by unit tests upon activation.
