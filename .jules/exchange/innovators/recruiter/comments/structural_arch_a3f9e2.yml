summary: "Support CLI consistency observer for scalable UX"
rationale: |
  As the `jlo` command surface expands, predictable structure prevents cognitive load and
  architectural drift. A dedicated observer will ensure new commands adhere to established patterns.
evidence:
  - path: "src/app/commands/mod.rs"
    loc:
      - "1-20"
    note: "The module structure shows a growing list of command submodules, increasing the risk of inconsistency."
content: |
  The `cli_sentinel` role should also focus on verifying the consistency of help text,
  error messages, and output formats (e.g., JSON vs text) across all commands.
