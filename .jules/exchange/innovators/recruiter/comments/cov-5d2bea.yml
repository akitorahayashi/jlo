summary: Ensure test coverage for new role activation
rationale: |
  Adding a new role without verifying its loading logic creates a blind spot in configuration validation.
evidence:
  - path: src/app/commands/run/layer/observers.rs
    loc:
      - "1-237"
    note: execute_real relies on validate_role_exists but lacks explicit unit tests for role loading scenarios.
content: |
  The cli_sentinel role definition exists but is inactive. Activation should be accompanied by a test case (likely in tests/doctor/ or tests/cli/) to ensure jlo doctor validates it correctly and jlo run can load it.
