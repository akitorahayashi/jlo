title: "Activate Rustacean Observer Role"
problem: |
  The repository is primarily written in Rust, but the active observer set (in .jlo/roles/observers/) lacks a dedicated Rust language expert.
  This results in code reviews that miss subtle ownership issues, non-idiomatic patterns, and potential safety violations that general-purpose reviewers might overlook.
introduction: |
  Introduce the `rustacean` observer role by instantiating it from `src/assets/roles/observers/language/rustacean/role.yml` into `.jlo/roles/observers/`.
  This role specializes in enforcing Rust best practices, including ownership discipline, error handling semantics, and concurrency safety.
expected_value: |
  - Improved code quality through expert scrutiny of Rust-specific constructs.
  - Reduction in technical debt related to memory safety and performance (e.g., unnecessary cloning).
  - Consistent enforcement of idiomatic Rust patterns across the codebase.
