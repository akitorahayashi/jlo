title: "Update Recruiter Role Definition Paths"
problem: |
  The `recruiter` role is instructed to analyze role definitions in `.jules/roles/observers/*/role.yml` and `.jules/roles/innovators/*/role.yml`. However, repository inspection and `AGENTS.md` confirm that role instance definitions reside in `.jlo/roles/` (instances) and source definitions in `src/assets/roles/`. The `.jules/roles/` directory contains only system contracts and schemas, not `role.yml` files. This misdirection causes the recruiter to look in the wrong place for evidence, effectively disabling its primary function.
introduction: |
  Update the `recruiter` role definition (specifically `analysis_points` and `evidence_expectations`) to reference the correct `.jlo/roles/` directory for active role instances. This aligns the role's instructions with the actual system architecture, ensuring the agent inspects the deployed configuration rather than a non-existent location.
expected_value: |
  The recruiter role will be able to correctly identify role gaps, boundary overlaps, and missing capabilities by analyzing the actual deployed role files. This restores the intended functionality of the recruiter persona and enables it to produce valid hiring proposals based on repository reality.
