title: "Activate cli_sentinel Observer"
problem: |
  The `src/app/commands/` directory exhibits structural inconsistency, mixing file-based modules (`init.rs`, `update.rs`) with directory-based modules (`add/`, `create/`). Furthermore, there is no active mechanism to enforce SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) design principles or audit option proliferation, leading to potential UX degradation as the CLI grows.
introduction: |
  Instantiate the `cli_sentinel` role from `src/assets/roles/observers/experience/cli_sentinel/role.yml` into `.jlo/roles/observers/cli_sentinel/`. This role is already defined but inactive. Its purpose is to audit CLI command designs for SVO consistency, option discipline, and I/O standards.
expected_value: |
  Activating this role will provide continuous feedback on CLI design, driving the standardization of `src/app/commands/` and ensuring future commands adhere to strict SVO principles. This reduces cognitive load for users and maintainers and prevents "verb escape" and option bloat.
