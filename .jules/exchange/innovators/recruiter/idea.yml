title: "Activate `cli_sentinel` Observer Role"
problem: |
  The codebase exhibits inconsistent CLI command structures (file-based vs directory-based modules) and lacks a unified enforcement of Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) semantics. This leads to fragmented user experience and higher cognitive load for maintainers. The `taxonomy` observer has flagged inconsistent terminology, and `structural_arch` has endorsed `cli_sentinel` activation.
introduction: |
  Activate the `cli_sentinel` observer role from `src/assets/roles/observers/experience/` by instantiating it in `.jlo/roles/observers/` and scheduling it in `.jlo/scheduled.toml`. This role will enforce SVO structure, audit command designs, and ensure consistent UX across all CLI interactions.
expected_value: |
  - Consistent CLI command structure and terminology.
  - Reduced cognitive load for users and developers.
  - Automated enforcement of SVO semantics preventing "verb escape".
  - Clearer boundary for CLI design responsibility.
