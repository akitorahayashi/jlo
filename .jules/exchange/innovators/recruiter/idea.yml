title: "Activate cli_sentinel observer for CLI UX consistency"
problem: |
  The `jlo` repository is a CLI product with an expanding command surface.
  Currently, there is no dedicated observer role responsible for maintaining
  semantic consistency (SVO structure), option discipline, or output standards.
  This risks UX degradation as new commands (like `workflow` subcommands) are added.
introduction: |
  Instantiate the `cli_sentinel` role from `src/assets/roles/observers/experience/cli_sentinel`.
  This role will audit CLI command designs for SVO structure, mandatory option dependence,
  and naming consistency, ensuring the tool remains intuitive.
expected_value: |
  Prevent UX entropy in the primary user interface.
  Ensure new commands follow established patterns.
  Reduce learning curve for users by enforcing semantic predictability.
