# Changes Summary Schema
#
# Authoritative schema for .jules/exchange/changes.yml.
#
# Purpose: advisory summary of recent codebase activity for downstream layers.
# Observers use these entries to decide whether a change falls within their
# responsibility. Each entry must be self-contained and actionable.
#
# Exactly 5 entries are required. If fewer than 5 distinct themes exist,
# group minor changes under a broader theme to fill all slots.
