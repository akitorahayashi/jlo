summary: "Remove duplicate test harness code in tests/common/."

# Content
goal: |
  Eliminate code duplication in test harnesses.

  The `tests/common/` directory contains dead code that duplicates the functionality found in `tests/harness/test_context.rs`.

impact: |
  Maintenance burden and confusion about which harness to use.

desired_outcome: |
  `tests/common/` should be removed or refactored to use `tests/harness/test_context.rs` if needed, or simply deleted if unused.

constraints: []
risks: []
