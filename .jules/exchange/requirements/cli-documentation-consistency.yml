title: "CLI Documentation Consistency"
label: "docs" # Must match a key in .jules/github-labels.json
priority: "medium"
summary: "Update CLI documentation for missing arguments and aliases, and address terminology inconsistencies."

# Content
goal: |
  Ensure the CLI documentation is accurate, complete, and consistent with the codebase, reducing user confusion and friction.

problem: |
  Several CLI features are undocumented, including the `--phase` argument for innovators, the `wf` alias for `jlo workflow`, and the `--cli` flag for `jlo update`. Additionally, terminology ("Role" vs "Layer") and pluralization ("Narrator" vs "Observers") are inconsistent across the CLI and documentation.

impact: |
  Users may not be aware of useful features or may be confused by inconsistent naming, leading to a poor developer experience and difficulty navigating the system.

desired_outcome: |
  `README.md` lists all CLI arguments and aliases. Terminology is clarified in documentation or code is refactored for consistency. Layer naming conventions are standardized.

verification_criteria:
  - "Manual review of `README.md` against `jlo --help` output."
