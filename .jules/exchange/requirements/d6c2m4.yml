title: "Unify Documentation"
label: "docs"
priority: "low"
summary: "Consolidate documentation indexes, fix incorrect references, and fill missing guides."
goal: |
  Establish a single source of truth for documentation indexing (`docs/README.md`).
  Ensure all layers (including Integrator) are documented.
  Correct inaccurate command references.
problem: |
  Two documentation indexes exist (Root AGENTS.md vs docs/README.md).
  Dev docs in `src/` are unindexed.
  Architectural principles are misplaced in Root AGENTS.md.
  Innovator guide references a non-existent `jlo bootstrap` command.
  Integrator layer lacks an operational guide.
impact: |
  Discovery issues for developers and agents.
  Confusion due to incorrect commands.
  Incomplete understanding of the system (Integrator).
desired_outcome: |
  `docs/README.md` is the sole index, referencing `src/AGENTS.md` and others.
  Root `AGENTS.md` focuses on high-level agent instructions, not general docs indexing.
  Architectural principles moved to `docs/architecture/`.
  `docs/operations/layers/INTEGRATOR.md` exists.
  Innovator guide references `jlo workflow bootstrap`.
affected_areas:
  - "docs/README.md"
  - "AGENTS.md"
  - "src/AGENTS.md"
  - "docs/operations/layers/"
acceptance_criteria:
  - "Root AGENTS.md does not duplicate the doc index."
  - "All `AGENTS.md` files are reachable from `docs/README.md`."
  - "Integrator layer documentation exists."
  - "Innovator guide has correct commands."
verification_criteria:
  - "Manual inspection of `docs/README.md` and `AGENTS.md`."
