title: Dead Code CLI Sentinel Role Uninstantiated
label: bugs
priority: medium
summary: The cli_sentinel role is defined but not instantiated or tested.
goal: |
  Instantiate the `cli_sentinel` role in the control plane and ensure it is covered by tests.
problem: |
  The role `cli_sentinel` is defined in `src/assets/roles/observers/experience/cli_sentinel/role.yml` but is not instantiated in `.jlo/roles/observers/`. It represents dead code and configuration risk.
impact: |
  The role is not performing its intended function (auditing CLI designs), leaving the CLI vulnerable to inconsistency.
desired_outcome: |
  The `cli_sentinel` role is active in `.jlo/roles/observers/` and scheduled for execution.
affected_areas:
  - .jlo/roles/observers/
  - .jlo/scheduled.toml
acceptance_criteria:
  - "`cli_sentinel` role exists in `.jlo/roles/observers/`."
  - "`cli_sentinel` is listed in `.jlo/scheduled.toml`."
verification_criteria:
  - "Verify that the cli_sentinel role is listed in the active roles configuration."
