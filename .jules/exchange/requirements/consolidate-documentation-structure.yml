summary: "Centralize verification instructions and ensure all guides are discoverable from root documentation."

# Content
goal: |
  Remove duplicated documentation to establish a Single Source of Truth (SSOT) and ensure all guides are indexed and discoverable.

problem: |
  1. Verification instructions are duplicated between `AGENTS.md` and `src/AGENTS.md`, leading to potential drift and confusion.
  2. Several guides in `docs/` are orphaned (not linked from `README.md` or `AGENTS.md`), making them invisible to users and agents.

impact: |
  Duplication causes confusion about which instructions are canonical. Orphaned guides reduce the value of documentation efforts as they are rarely found or used.

desired_outcome: |
  - `src/AGENTS.md` is the SSOT for development verification commands.
  - `AGENTS.md` refers to `src/AGENTS.md` or contains a high-level summary linking to it.
  - All files in `docs/` are linked from an index (e.g., `docs/README.md` or root `AGENTS.md`).
