title: "Standardize CLI UX"
label: "refacts"
priority: "medium"
summary: "Standardize CLI arguments, reduce nesting, unify role keys, and correct terminology."
goal: |
  Create a consistent and intuitive user experience across all CLI commands.
  Ensure consistent terminology ("Requirement", "Role") in the interface and codebase.
problem: |
  `jlo run` has inconsistent argument handling (positional vs flags).
  `jlo workflow` is deeply nested.
  `jlo init` uses mutually exclusive flags instead of subcommands/positional.
  Perspective files use different keys (`observer` vs `role`) for the same concept.
  The term "Issue" is used where "Requirement" is meant.
impact: |
  User confusion and friction.
  Increased learning curve.
  Codebase inconsistency.
desired_outcome: |
  `jlo run` uses consistent arguments.
  `jlo workflow` structure is flattened.
  `jlo init` supports subcommands or positional mode argument.
  Perspective files use `role` consistently (or similar).
  "Issue" is replaced by "Requirement" in domain logic.
affected_areas:
  - "src/app/cli/"
  - "src/domain/layers/"
  - "src/domain/workstations/perspectives/"
acceptance_criteria:
  - "`jlo run` subcommands follow a consistent pattern."
  - "`jlo workflow` commands are no more than 3 levels deep."
  - "`jlo init` supports `jlo init remote` (or similar)."
  - "Perspective files use consistent keys."
  - "References to 'Issue' in domain logic are renamed to 'Requirement'."
verification_criteria:
  - "Run `jlo --help` to verify command structure."
  - "Inspect code for 'Issue' usage."
