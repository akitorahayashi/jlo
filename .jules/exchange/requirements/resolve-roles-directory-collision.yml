priority: "high"
summary: "Resolve terminology collision between system layers and role instances."

# Content
goal: |
  Clarify the directory structure to distinguish between architectural Layers and Role personas.

problem: |
  The `.jules/roles` directory contains Layer definitions (e.g. `observers`, `narrator`), while `.jlo/roles` contains Role instances. This violates "One Concept, One Preferred Term" and creates confusion.

impact: |
  Developers and agents may be confused about where to find or place files.

desired_outcome: |
  The directory structure should clearly distinguish between layers and roles. For example, renaming `.jules/roles` to `.jules/layers` or similar, if feasible, or clarifying documentation. Given the constraint of preserving existing structure if expensive to change, documentation clarification might be the first step, but a structural change is preferred if possible.

constraints:
  - "Must ensure backward compatibility or provide a migration path if directories are renamed."

risks:
  - "Breaking changes if paths are hardcoded in many places."

# Specifics
affected_areas:
  - ".jules/roles/"
  - "AGENTS.md"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "The ambiguity is resolved either by renaming or strict documentation updates."

verification_criteria:
  - "Check directory structure and AGENTS.md."

# Analysis Flags
requires_deep_analysis: true
deep_analysis_reason: "Renaming a core directory like .jules/roles/ involves checking all references in code and prompts."
