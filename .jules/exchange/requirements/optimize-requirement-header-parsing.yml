summary: "Optimize RequirementHeader::read to avoid reading the entire file."

# Content
goal: |
  Improve the efficiency of reading requirement headers by only reading the necessary part of the file.

problem: |
  `RequirementHeader::read` reads the entire file content into memory to parse just the header. This is inefficient for large requirement files.

impact: |
  Unnecessary memory usage and potential performance degradation when processing many or large requirement files.

desired_outcome: |
  `RequirementHeader::read` should stream the file or read only the first block to extract the header.

constraints: []
risks: []
