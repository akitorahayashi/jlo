title: Decouple Init Command Persistence Logic
label: refacts
priority: medium
summary: "`init` command couples configuration persistence logic directly within the command execution."
goal: |
  Refactor `init` command to delegate persistence to an adapter or service.
problem: |
  The `init` command in `src/app/commands/init.rs` directly handles TOML parsing and file persistence logic, violating SRP and Boundary Sovereignty.
impact: |
  Hard to test, hard to maintain, tight coupling.
desired_outcome: |
  Persistence logic is moved to a dedicated adapter/port.
affected_areas:
  - src/app/commands/init.rs
acceptance_criteria:
  - "`init` command orchestrates logic but does not implement low-level persistence."
verification_criteria:
  - Code review.
requires_deep_analysis: false
deep_analysis_reason: ""
