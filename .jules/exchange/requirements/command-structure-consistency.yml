title: Standardize Command Module Structure
label: refacts
priority: medium
summary: Inconsistent command module structure in `src/app/commands/`.
goal: |
  Standardize command modules to be either all file-based or all directory-based (preferably directory-based for scalability).
problem: |
  "`src/app/commands/` mixes file-based modules (`init.rs`) and directory-based modules (`add/`), violating structural consistency."
impact: |
  Reduced discoverability and maintainability.
desired_outcome: |
  Consistent module structure.
affected_areas:
  - src/app/commands/
acceptance_criteria:
  - All top-level commands follow the same structural pattern.
verification_criteria:
  - "Verify that all top-level command modules in src/app/commands/ share a consistent structure."
