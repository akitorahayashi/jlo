title: "Explicit Domain Models for Exchange Artifacts"
label: "refacts"
priority: "medium"
summary: "Move implicit exchange structs to the domain layer."

# Content
goal: |
  Establish canonical domain models for exchange artifacts like Proposals and Perspectives.

problem: |
  Core domain entities are defined as private ad-hoc structs within application command handlers (e.g., `ProposalData` in `publish_proposals.rs`). This violates "Boundary Sovereignty".

impact: |
  Logic is scattered, and the domain model is weak and implicit. It is difficult to reuse these structures or enforce validation centrally.

desired_outcome: |
  `ProposalData` and `PerspectiveData` (and others) are defined as public structs in `src/domain/exchange/`.

# Specifics
affected_areas:
  - "src/app/commands/workflow/exchange/publish_proposals.rs"
  - "src/domain/exchange/proposals/mod.rs"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "`ProposalData` struct is moved to `src/domain/exchange/proposals/` and made public."
  - "Command handlers import the domain struct."

verification_criteria:
  - "Check file structure and imports."
