summary: "Decompose the monolithic AppError enum into domain-specific error types."

# Content
goal: |
  Improve error handling granularity and reduce coupling by breaking down the monolithic `AppError` enum.

problem: |
  The `AppError` enum is a monolithic error type that mixes I/O, configuration, domain logic, and external tool errors. This makes it difficult to handle specific error cases gracefully and increases coupling.

impact: |
  Changes to one part of the system (e.g., git adapter) force recompilation of unrelated modules that import `AppError`. Error handling logic becomes large and unwieldy.

desired_outcome: |
  `AppError` is refactored into smaller, domain-specific error types (e.g., `GitError`, `ConfigError`, `DomainError`) or a hierarchical structure.

# Specifics
affected_areas:
  - "src/domain/error.rs"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "`AppError` is significantly smaller."
  - "Specific errors are handled without matching on a giant enum."

verification_criteria:
  - "Check `src/domain/error.rs` size and structure."
