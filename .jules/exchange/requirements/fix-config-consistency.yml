title: "Fix Configuration Consistency and Naming"
label: "refacts"
priority: "medium"
summary: "Use canonical config path logic and rename RunConfig to reflect its scope."

# Content
goal: |
  Ensure configuration paths are resolved via the domain layer and configuration types are named accurately.

problem: |
  `src/adapters/control_plane_config.rs` uses a hardcoded string for the config path, bypassing `src/domain/config/paths.rs`. Additionally, `RunConfig` is named too narrowly for its actual role as the root configuration object.

impact: |
  Risk of configuration path drift. Confusion about the purpose of `RunConfig`.

desired_outcome: |
  Adapter uses `src/domain/config/paths.rs`. `RunConfig` is renamed to `ControlPlaneConfig` or similar.

constraints: []
