summary: "Deduplicate scaffold content and organize documentation into a hierarchical structure."

# Content
goal: |
  Create a single source of truth for documentation and organize it logically into subdirectories to improve discoverability and maintainability.

problem: |
  `src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md` duplicates the "Prompt Hierarchy" section from the root `AGENTS.md` and contains stale schema references. The `docs/` directory is a flat list of specialized documents, violating namespace discipline and making it hard to find relevant information.

impact: |
  Maintenance overhead is increased due to the need to update duplicate content in multiple places. The flat documentation structure hinders navigation and comprehension of the project's documentation.

desired_outcome: |
  Scaffold `AGENTS.md` references the root `AGENTS.md` or uses a build-time inclusion mechanism to avoid manual duplication. The `docs/` directory is reorganized into logical subdirectories (e.g., `guides/`, `architecture/`, `reference/`).

# Specifics
affected_areas:
  - "src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md"
  - "docs/"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "`src/assets/scaffold/AGENTS.md` does not duplicate the \"Prompt Hierarchy\" section manually."
  - "Stale schema references in scaffold assets are corrected."
  - "`docs/` directory contains subdirectories grouping related documents."

verification_criteria:
  - "File existence checks for new documentation structure."
  - "Content comparison to ensure no divergent duplicates remain."
