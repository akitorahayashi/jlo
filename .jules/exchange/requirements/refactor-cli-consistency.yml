title: "Standardize CLI UX and Structure"
label: "refacts"
priority: "medium"
summary: "Fix inconsistent argument handling, layer pluralization, and command module structure."

# Content
goal: |
  Ensure a consistent and predictable CLI experience for users and a clean internal structure for developers.

problem: |
  `jlo run` mixes plural/singular layer names. Argument handling (flags vs positional, interactive prompts) is inconsistent. `src/app/commands/` is messy.

impact: |
  User confusion and reduced discoverability. Developer friction when adding commands.

desired_outcome: |
  All layers use consistent naming (singular/plural). Argument handling is uniform. `src/app/commands/` uses subdirectories consistently.

constraints: []
risks: []

# Specifics
affected_areas:
  - "src/app/cli/"
  - "src/app/commands/"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "`RunLayer` variants are consistent (e.g., all singular or all plural where appropriate)."
  - "Mandatory arguments are handled consistently (positional or flag)."
  - "Interactive prompts are consistent."
  - "`src/app/commands/` contains only directories (or consistent structure)."

verification_criteria:
  - "CLI help text review."
  - "Code review of `src/app/commands/`."
