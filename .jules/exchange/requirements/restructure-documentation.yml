title: "Restructure Documentation Layout"
label: "docs"
priority: "medium"
summary: "Move architectural and operational documentation to standard locations."

# Content
goal: |
  Move core architectural (`Scaffold Design`) and operational (`Template System`) documentation from `src/assets/` to `docs/` to improve findability. Rename `docs/operations/REPRODUCTION_GUIDE.md` to `docs/operations/SETUP_GUIDE.md` to better reflect its content.

problem: |
  Key documentation is buried in `src/assets/scaffold/` and `src/assets/templates/`, which are technically resource directories but not the standard place for human-readable docs. Additionally, the "Reproduction Guide" actually describes setup/deployment, which is misleading.

impact: |
  Developers and users struggle to find critical documentation, leading to misuse or lack of understanding of the system.

desired_outcome: |
  All primary documentation resides in `docs/` or the root `AGENTS.md`. `src/assets/` contains only functional resources.
