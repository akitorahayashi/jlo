title: "Add Critical Path Tests"
label: "tests" # Must match a key in .jules/github-labels.json
priority: "high"
summary: "Add unit tests for critical paths: proposal validation, exchange paths, and requirement path validation."

# Content
goal: |
  Ensure critical infrastructure is tested to prevent regressions.

problem: |
  Zero coverage on exchange paths and security-critical path validation. Missing negative tests for proposal validation.

impact: |
  Silent failures, security vulnerabilities, or regression risks.

desired_outcome: |
  High coverage on paths.rs modules and validate_requirement_path. Negative tests for publish_proposals.

constraints: [] # list of constraints/assumptions (optional)
