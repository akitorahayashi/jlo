title: "Fix Governance Documentation Overlaps"
label: "docs"
priority: "high"
summary: "Remove duplicate governance info and fix scope violations in AGENTS.md files."

# Content
goal: |
  Ensure each piece of governance information (e.g., branch strategy, commands) has a single source of truth.

problem: |
  `Branch Strategy` is duplicated in `.github/AGENTS.md`. `CLI Commands` list in `src/app/AGENTS.md` is volatile. `src/testing/AGENTS.md` violates scope.

impact: |
  Inconsistent documentation leads to confusion and errors. Maintenance burden is doubled.

desired_outcome: |
  Duplicates are removed. Volatile lists are moved to user docs or removed. Scope violations are fixed.

constraints: []
risks: []

# Specifics
affected_areas:
  - ".github/AGENTS.md"
  - "src/app/AGENTS.md"
  - "src/testing/AGENTS.md"
  - "tests/AGENTS.md"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "`.github/AGENTS.md` references `docs/CONTROL_PLANE_OWNERSHIP.md` instead of duplicating it."
  - "`src/app/AGENTS.md` does not list volatile commands."
  - "`src/testing/AGENTS.md` does not govern `tests/`."

verification_criteria:
  - "Manual review of AGENTS.md files."
