title: Optimize ComponentGraph Resolution
label: refacts
priority: low
summary: "`ComponentGraph::resolve` exhibits excessive cloning."
goal: |
  Optimize `ComponentGraph::resolve` to reduce unnecessary cloning.
problem: |
  "`ComponentGraph::resolve` in `src/domain/component_graph.rs` clones `Component` structs extensively during resolution."
impact: |
  Performance inefficiency (though likely minor at current scale).
desired_outcome: |
  Reduced memory allocation and copying during graph resolution.
affected_areas:
  - src/domain/component_graph.rs
acceptance_criteria:
  - Cloning is minimized.
verification_criteria:
  - Code review.
requires_deep_analysis: false
deep_analysis_reason: ""
