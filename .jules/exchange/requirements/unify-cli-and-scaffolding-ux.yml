title: "Unify CLI and Scaffolding UX"
label: "refacts"
priority: "medium"
summary: "Resolve inconsistencies in CLI arguments, flags, and scaffolding terminology to improve user experience."
goal: |
  Create a consistent and intuitive user experience for the `jlo` CLI and the scaffolded file structure.
problem: |
  The CLI currently suffers from inconsistent argument naming (`name` vs `role`), overloaded flags (`-r`), and syntax drift (`jlo run` arguments). Additionally, there is a disconnect between source layer naming (`jules/layers`) and deployed role structure (`.jules/roles`).
impact: |
  These inconsistencies increase cognitive load, cause confusion, and make the tool harder to learn and use.
desired_outcome: |
  The CLI uses consistent terminology and flags. The scaffolding structure is aligned with the source concepts or consistently mapped.
affected_areas:
  - "src/app/cli/mod.rs"
  - "src/app/cli/run.rs"
  - "src/adapters/assets/scaffold_assets.rs"
  - "src/assets/scaffold/jules/layers"
acceptance_criteria:
  - "Unify CLI arguments: Use `role` consistently for role names in `create` and `add` commands."
  - "Resolve flag collision: Ensure `-r` is not ambiguous or use different short flags."
  - "Align `jlo run` syntax with documentation (or update docs if the flag is preferred)."
  - "Address the structural drift between `layers` (source) and `roles` (deployed), likely by renaming source to `roles` to match the user-facing concept."
verification_criteria:
  - "Run `jlo --help` to verify consistent argument naming."
  - "Verify `jlo run` commands work as documented."
  - "Check that source directory structure matches the intended design."
