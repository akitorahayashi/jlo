summary: "Correct the recruiter role definition to point to the correct role directory."

# Content
goal: |
  Ensure the recruiter role analyzes the correct active role definitions in `.jlo/roles/` instead of the system contracts in `.jules/roles/`.

problem: |
  The `recruiter` role is instructed to analyze role definitions in `.jules/roles/observers/*/role.yml` and `.jules/roles/innovators/*/role.yml`. However, active role instances reside in `.jlo/roles/`. This misdirection prevents the role from accessing the files it is designed to analyze.

impact: |
  The recruiter role will fail to analyze the actual role definitions, leading to incorrect or missing insights about the team structure.

desired_outcome: |
  The recruiter role's `analysis_points` and `evidence_expectations` should point to `.jlo/roles/` paths.
