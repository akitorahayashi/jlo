priority: "low"
summary: "Define and document the standard procedure and schema for creating and maintaining skills."

# Content
goal: |
  Establish a clear, documented framework for skill creation to enable consistent contributions and lower the barrier to entry for new skill authors.

problem: |
  There is no documented procedure or template for creating new skills in `.agents/skills/`. The `agents/openai.yaml` schema contains undefined fields like `display_name` and `default_prompt`. Existing skills have implicit branching logic in their procedures that is not clearly defined.

impact: |
  This leads to inconsistent skill implementations, confusion for authors about required fields, and difficulty in understanding the intended flow of skill execution.

desired_outcome: |
  A "Create Skill" guide and template are available. The `agents/openai.yaml` schema is fully documented. Skill procedures explicitly define branching logic (e.g., Creation vs. Review modes).
