title: Resolve Update Command Ambiguity
label: refacts
priority: medium
summary: "`jlo update` is overloaded for both workspace and binary updates."
goal: |
  Separate binary upgrade functionality from workspace update, or clarify the command interface.
problem: |
  "`jlo update` handles control-plane updates (`update.rs`) and CLI binary upgrades (`cli_upgrade.rs` via `--cli`), creating semantic collision."
impact: |
  User confusion about what "update" does.
desired_outcome: |
  Distinct commands or clear subcommands/flags for different update types.
affected_areas:
  - src/app/cli/mod.rs
  - src/app/commands/update.rs
  - src/app/commands/cli_upgrade.rs
acceptance_criteria:
  - Command interface is unambiguous.
verification_criteria:
  - Review CLI help and command structure.
