title: Strongly Typed Git Adapters
label: refacts
priority: medium
summary: "`GitCommandAdapter` relies on brittle string construction and parsing."
goal: |
  Refactor `GitCommandAdapter` to use strong types and possibly a dedicated git library (like `git2`) instead of shell commands.
problem: |
  "`GitCommandAdapter` in `src/adapters/git_command.rs` relies on string construction for shell commands and parsing for results, which is error-prone."
impact: |
  Increased risk of runtime errors due to command formatting or output parsing issues.
desired_outcome: |
  Git interactions are type-safe and robust.
affected_areas:
  - src/adapters/git_command.rs
acceptance_criteria:
  - Git operations use structured arguments and return structured types.
verification_criteria:
  - Code review.
requires_deep_analysis: false
