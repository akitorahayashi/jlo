title: "Standardize Documentation and Guides"
label: "docs"
priority: "medium"
summary: "Address documentation gaps, drifts, and inconsistencies across the codebase and guides."
goal: |
  Ensure all documentation (README, AGENTS.md, docs/) is accurate, up-to-date, and consistent with the codebase.
problem: |
  Several documentation issues have been identified: ambiguous mapping between source layers and deployed roles, missing documentation for domain layers and single-role layers, outdated secret documentation, and duplicate design principles.
impact: |
  Inaccurate or missing documentation leads to developer confusion, increased onboarding time, and potential misuse of the system.
desired_outcome: |
  Documentation accurately reflects the current state of the system, including correct directory mappings, up-to-date secret usage, and comprehensive guides for all layers.
