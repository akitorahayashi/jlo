title: "Restructure Documentation Architecture"
label: "docs"
priority: "high"
summary: "Organize `docs/` into `architecture/` and `operations/`, add `README.md`, fix indexing."

# Content
goal: |
  Enforce a clean separation between architectural definitions and operational guides within the `docs/` directory, and provide a clear entry point.

problem: |
  The `docs/` directory is flat and mixes architectural docs with operational guides. It lacks a README, and indexing responsibility is split between root `AGENTS.md` and `docs/AGENTS.md`.

impact: |
  New contributors struggle to find relevant documentation. The architecture is harder to govern.

desired_outcome: |
  `docs/` contains `architecture/` and `operations/` subdirectories. `docs/README.md` exists and serves as the index. `AGENTS.md` indexing is consolidated.

constraints: []
risks: []

# Specifics
affected_areas:
  - "docs/"
  - "AGENTS.md"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "`docs/architecture/` contains architectural docs."
  - "`docs/operations/` contains operational guides."
  - "`docs/README.md` links to all sub-areas."
  - "Root `AGENTS.md` delegates indexing to `docs/README.md` or `docs/AGENTS.md`."

verification_criteria:
  - "File system check of `docs/` structure."
  - "Link check in `docs/README.md`."
