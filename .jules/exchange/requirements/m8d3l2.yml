title: "Model Observer Perspectives"
label: "refacts"
priority: "medium"
summary: "Implement a domain model for Observer perspectives and add validation logic."
goal: |
  Formalize the Observer perspective data structure in the domain model.
  Ensure Observer perspectives are validated during `jlo doctor`.
problem: |
  Observer perspectives are currently untyped and unvalidated, leading to potential configuration errors.
  There is a discrepancy between Innovator (modeled) and Observer (unmodeled) handling.
impact: |
  Inconsistent behavior and potential runtime errors due to invalid observer configuration.
  Developer confusion due to lack of a defined schema.
desired_outcome: |
  A `Perspective` struct in `src/domain/workstations/perspectives/model.rs` that covers Observer needs (or a separate `ObserverPerspective` struct).
  Validation logic in `jlo doctor` that checks observer perspective files against the model.
affected_areas:
  - "src/domain/workstations/perspectives/model.rs"
  - "src/app/commands/doctor/"
acceptance_criteria:
  - "Observer perspective fields (goals, log, rules) are defined in the domain model."
  - "`jlo doctor` successfully validates a correct observer perspective."
  - "`jlo doctor` fails on an invalid observer perspective."
verification_criteria:
  - "Run `cargo test`"
  - "Run `jlo doctor` and verify output."
