title: "Implement Property-Based Testing"
label: "tests"
priority: "low"
summary: "Introduce property-based testing for domain logic."

# Content
goal: |
  Add `proptest` (or similar) to the project and implement property-based tests for domain logic (e.g., configuration parsing, validation rules) to cover edge cases missed by example-based tests.

problem: |
  Current testing relies exclusively on fixed examples, leaving complex state spaces (like input validation) potentially vulnerable to edge cases.

impact: |
  Increased risk of unhandled edge cases and bugs in complex logic.

desired_outcome: |
  Critical domain logic is verified with property-based tests.

risks: []

# Specifics
affected_areas:
  - "Cargo.toml"
  - "src/domain/"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "`proptest` dependency added."
  - "At least one property-based test implemented for a domain module (e.g., `run_options` or `role_id`)."

verification_criteria:
  - "Run `cargo test`."
