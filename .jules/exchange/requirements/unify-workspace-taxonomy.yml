title: "Unify Workspace Taxonomy"
label: "refacts"
priority: "high"
summary: "Align terminology (Layer/Role, Issue/Requirement) and directory structures across CLI, Docs, and Code."

# Content
goal: |
  Eliminate confusion caused by inconsistent naming and structures. The codebase, documentation, and user-facing CLI should speak the same language.

problem: |
  1. "Workstream" is documented but missing from the codebase.
  2. "Layer" (domain) vs "Role" (scaffold/deployed) naming conflict.
  3. "Issue" vs "Requirement" terminology inconsistency.
  4. Layer naming inconsistency (Singular vs Plural, e.g., `Observers` vs `Observer`).
  5. CLI implementation (named args) contradicts documentation (positional args).
  6. Scaffold structure in docs (`.jules/roles/`) contradicts implementation (`src/assets/scaffold/jules/layers/`).

impact: |
  Inconsistencies increase cognitive load, making the tool harder to learn and use. Developers and agents struggle to map concepts to implementation.

desired_outcome: |
  - "Workstream" concept is either implemented or removed from docs.
  - "Layer" and "Role" usage is strictly defined and consistent.
  - "Requirement" is used consistently over "Issue" in domain logic.
  - Layer names are consistent (singular or plural) everywhere.
  - CLI and Docs match exactly.
  - Scaffold structure matches documentation.

acceptance_criteria:
  - "Grepping for 'workstream' yields consistent results (either all gone or fully implemented)."
  - "`Layer::Observers` and `Layer::Innovators` use consistent naming."
  - "CLI help text matches README usage."
  - "Domain types use `Requirement` terminology consistently."

verification_criteria:
  - "Manual review of glossary vs codebase."
  - "Run `jlo run --help` and compare with docs."
