title: "Refine Documentation Architecture"
label: "docs"
priority: "low"
summary: "Reorganize the `docs/` directory, add missing multi-role layer documentation, and remove volatile tech stack details from `AGENTS.md`."

# Content
goal: |
  Clean up the documentation information architecture. Specifically:
  1. Add documentation for multi-role layers (`OBSERVERS.md`, `INNOVATORS.md`) to `docs/layers/`.
  2. Organize high-entropy/specific operational maps (e.g., `WORKFLOW_BRANCH_IMPACT_MAP.md`) into subdirectories within `docs/` to reduce clutter.
  3. Remove the volatile "Tech Stack" table from `src/AGENTS.md` to avoid manual maintenance of dependency lists.

problem: |
  The documentation structure is becoming cluttered and inconsistent. Missing layer documentation creates knowledge gaps. High-entropy filenames in the root `docs/` folder make navigation difficult. Manual dependency lists in `AGENTS.md` quickly become outdated.

impact: |
  Decreased discoverability of documentation. Maintenance burden for volatile docs. Incomplete architectural understanding.

desired_outcome: |
  - `docs/layers/` contains documentation for all layers (single and multi-role).
  - `docs/` root is clean and contains only high-level guides or index files.
  - `src/AGENTS.md` focuses on high-level architecture and agent instructions, not dependency lists.

# Specifics
affected_areas:
  - "docs/layers/"
  - "docs/"
  - "src/AGENTS.md"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "`docs/layers/OBSERVERS.md` and `docs/layers/INNOVATORS.md` exist."
  - "Specific maps in `docs/` are moved to appropriate subfolders (e.g., `docs/ops/` or `docs/reference/`)."
  - "Tech Stack table is removed from `src/AGENTS.md`."

verification_criteria:
  - "File listing of `docs/` is cleaner."
  - "Review of `src/AGENTS.md`."
