title: "Refine AGENTS.md and Architecture Documentation"
label: "docs"
priority: "low"
summary: "Move architectural principles from AGENTS.md to architecture docs and remove duplication."

# Content
goal: |
  Establish a clear separation of concerns between developer workflow documentation (`AGENTS.md`) and architectural design documentation (`docs/architecture/`).

problem: |
  `AGENTS.md` currently contains canonical design principles and duplicates content found in `docs/architecture/CONTROL_PLANE_OWNERSHIP.md`. This violates "One document has one structural responsibility" and creates confusion about the single source of truth.

impact: |
  Developers may miss critical architectural rules if they only read one document, or encounter conflicting information if the duplicates drift.

desired_outcome: |
  `AGENTS.md` focuses on developer verification and workflow. Architectural principles are consolidated in `docs/architecture/`. Duplicated content is removed.

# Specifics
affected_areas:
  - "AGENTS.md"
  - "docs/architecture/CONTROL_PLANE_OWNERSHIP.md"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "`AGENTS.md` no longer contains the 'Critical Design Principles' section (unless specific to dev workflow)."
  - "'Worker Branch Merge Policy' information is deduplicated."

verification_criteria:
  - "Manual review of `AGENTS.md` and `docs/architecture/`."
