summary: "Investigate and reduce compilation time to improve feedback loop."

# Content
goal: |
  Reduce the project compilation time to enable a faster inner development loop.

problem: |
  Compilation time is significantly high (> 1 minute), hindering TDD and rapid iteration.

impact: |
  Developer productivity is reduced due to long wait times.

desired_outcome: |
  Compilation time is noticeably reduced. Unused dependencies are removed. Heavy dependencies are optimized or replaced if possible.

constraints: []
risks: []

# Specifics
affected_areas:
  - "Cargo.toml"

acceptance_criteria:
  - "Dependency tree analyzed."
  - "Unused dependencies removed."

verification_criteria:
  - "Measure `cargo build` time before and after changes."

# Analysis Flags
requires_deep_analysis: true
deep_analysis_reason: "Need to profile build times and dependency graph to identify bottlenecks."
