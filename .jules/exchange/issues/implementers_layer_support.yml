# Content
title: "Add Implementers Layer to Domain and Scaffolding"
summary: "The Implementers layer is documented but missing from the Layer enum and scaffolding logic."

affected_areas:
  - "src/domain/layer.rs"
  - "src/services/workspace_filesystem.rs"
  - "src/assets/templates/"

constraints:
  - "Must preserve existing enum values"

risks:
  - "Changes to Layer enum might affect exhaustiveness checks in match expressions"

problem: |
  The `Implementers` layer is a core part of the documented architecture (AGENTS.md, README.md) and CI workflows, but it is missing from the `Layer` enum in `src/domain/layer.rs`.
  Consequently, `Layer::ALL` and `from_dir_name` do not include it.
  This prevents the CLI from managing implementer roles or scaffolding them correctly, as seen in `FilesystemWorkspaceStore`.
  This violates Isomorphic Representation as the code does not reflect the documented system structure.

impact: |
  Users cannot use the CLI to interact with the Implementers layer (e.g., `jlo run implementers` might fail or behave unexpectedly if it relies on `Layer` enum).
  It creates confusion as the directory structure exists but the tool doesn't recognize it.

desired_outcome: |
  The `Layer` enum should include `Implementers`.
  `Layer::ALL` should include `Implementers`.
  `FilesystemWorkspaceStore` should handle `Implementers` correctly (if any special handling is needed, though `Layer::ALL` might suffice).
  The CLI should fully support the Implementers layer as documented.

acceptance_criteria:
  - "`Layer::Implementers` exists."
  - "`Layer::from_dir_name(\"implementers\")` returns `Some(Layer::Implementers)`."
  - "Filesystem discovery finds roles in `.jules/roles/implementers/`."
