# Content
title: "Support Implementers Layer in Domain and Scaffolding"
summary: "Add missing Implementers layer to Layer enum and templates to match documentation and directory structure."

affected_areas:
  - "src/domain/layer.rs"
  - "src/assets/templates/layers/"

constraints: []
risks: []

problem: |
  The `Implementers` layer is documented in `AGENTS.md` and exists in the `.jules/roles/implementers/` directory structure, but it is missing from the `Layer` enum in `src/domain/layer.rs` and has no corresponding template in `src/assets/templates/layers/`. This prevents the CLI from managing implementer roles and violates the Isomorphic Representation principle.

impact: |
  The `jlo` CLI cannot manage or scaffold Implementer agents, even though they are a core part of the documented workflow. This creates a disconnect between the architecture and the tooling.

desired_outcome: |
  The `Implementers` layer is fully supported in the codebase, including the domain model and scaffolding templates.

acceptance_criteria:
  - "`Layer` enum includes `Implementers` variant."
  - "`src/assets/templates/layers/implementer/` directory exists with valid `prompt.yml` template."
  - "CLI can scaffold implementer roles."
