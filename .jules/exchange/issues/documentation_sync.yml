# Content
title: "Synchronize Documentation with Implementation"
summary: "Update AGENTS.md and README.md to reflect the current state of roles, services, and workflows."

affected_areas:
  - "AGENTS.md"
  - "README.md"

constraints: []

risks:
  - "Documentation drift if not maintained"

problem: |
  Several discrepancies exist between the documentation and the codebase:
  1. `AGENTS.md` omits the `consistency` observer role.
  2. `AGENTS.md` lists an incomplete set of services in `src/services/`.
  3. `README.md` omits several GitHub Actions workflows and local actions present in `.github/`.
  4. `AGENTS.md` incorrectly states that `jlo` performs `ROLE_NAME` string replacement, while the code preserves placeholders.

impact: |
  New developers or agents (like me) relying on documentation may be confused or misled about the system's capabilities and architecture.
  The `consistency` role is invisible in docs.
  Mechanism descriptions (replacement) are factually wrong.

desired_outcome: |
  Documentation should accurately reflect the codebase.
  `AGENTS.md` should list all observers (including consistency).
  `AGENTS.md` should list all services.
  `AGENTS.md` should correctly describe the templating mechanism (preservation of placeholders).
  `README.md` should list relevant workflows and actions.

acceptance_criteria:
  - "`AGENTS.md` lists `consistency` role."
  - "`AGENTS.md` lists `clipboard_arboard`, `role_template_service`, `workspace_filesystem` in services."
  - "`AGENTS.md` correctly describes templating behavior."
  - "`README.md` lists all key workflows."
