# Content
title: "Decouple Service Names from Implementation Technology"
summary: "Rename services to be implementation-agnostic and consistent with their ports."

affected_areas:
  - "src/services/clipboard_arboard.rs"
  - "src/services/catalog.rs"

constraints: []

risks:
  - "Renaming structs requires updating all call sites."

problem: |
  Service implementation names are coupled to underlying technologies or inconsistent with their ports.
  1. `ArboardClipboard` is named after the underlying library `arboard`, violating Implementation Agnosticism.
  2. `EmbeddedCatalog` truncates the port name `ComponentCatalog`, whereas `EmbeddedRoleTemplateStore` correctly preserves `RoleTemplateStore`.

impact: |
  Coupling names to technology makes it harder to swap implementations later without renaming (or having misleading names).
  Inconsistent naming confuses developers about which port a service implements.

desired_outcome: |
  Services should have names that describe *what* they do or their *nature* (e.g. `Embedded`) rather than *how* they do it (e.g. `Arboard`).

acceptance_criteria:
  - "`ArboardClipboard` -> `ClipboardService` (or `LocalClipboard` / `SystemClipboard`)."
  - "`EmbeddedCatalog` -> `EmbeddedComponentCatalog`."
