# Content
title: "Synchronize Documentation with Implementation"
summary: "Update AGENTS.md and README.md to reflect current services, roles, workflows, and template behaviors."

affected_areas:
  - "AGENTS.md"
  - "README.md"

constraints: []
risks: []

problem: |
  Documentation is out of sync with the implementation:
  1. `AGENTS.md` misses several services (`clipboard_arboard`, `role_template_service`, `workspace_filesystem`) and the `consistency` role.
  2. `README.md` omits local actions and several GitHub workflows.
  3. `AGENTS.md` incorrectly states that `ROLE_NAME` is string-replaced, while the code preserves it.

impact: |
  Inaccurate documentation confuses developers and agents, leading to misuse of the system or misunderstandings about its capabilities and architecture.

desired_outcome: |
  Documentation accurately reflects the codebase, including all services, roles, workflows, and correct template behavior descriptions.

acceptance_criteria:
  - "`AGENTS.md` lists all current services and roles."
  - "`README.md` lists all current GitHub workflows and actions."
  - "`AGENTS.md` correctly describes `ROLE_NAME` placeholder behavior."
